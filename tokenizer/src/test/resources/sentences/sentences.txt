Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations HE STA E ' OF VOOD Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations HE STA E ' OF VOOD AND AGRICULTURE : : 194 / Prepared for the Third Session of the Conference of FAO , Geneva , Switzerland , 25 August 1947 Prive : 20 cents Geneva Aigcs .
: SUMMARY The world food situation and outlook , in the near future and further ahead , will be the central topic of discussion at the Geneva Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , beginning 25 August .
Needed lines of action will be decided on by representatives of some 50 nations .
Scarcity , not only of foodstuffs but of lumber and other forest products , textiles , seeds , fertilizers , draught power , and farm equipment will continue throughout most of Europe and Asia during the coming year .
Hopes of continued recovery in Europe 's indigenous food supplies were checked by last winter 's bad weather .
Diets in Western and Central Europe will be still lower next year , and in Asia they will remain at present very low levels , unless imports can be increased .
Even to hold the present line will require drastic action .
Twenty-eight million tons * of grain were imported into the deficit areas in 1946/47 .
Minimum import needs for Europe , North Africa , and Asia in 1947/48 may be estimated at 34 to 38 million tons without allowing for any improvement in bread rations , any additional livestock feeding , or any increase in working reserves .
Against this need , supplies of grain available for export from the surplus countries may be tentatively estimated at 30 to 34 million tons .
Even with somewhat larger supplies of certain other foods particularly potatoes , sugar , and fats the situation will continue to be grim .
Cessation of UNRRA activities and accumulated foreign exchange difficulties worsen the problem for nations in a weak bargaining position .
Every delay in improving this situation further impairs the working ability of labour , slows up reconstruction , adds to the physical damage caused by prolonged undernourishment , and accelerates social unrest .
s. \ \ Steps can still be taken to improve the 1948 harvest .
More fertilizers , farm machinery , and pesticides could be delivered within the next six months to areas of great need .
To accomplish this , the first step would be the immediate establishment of an intergovernmental committee for each main deficit area .
These committees would co-ordinate the requirements of the individual nations and discuss delivery possibilities with the supplying countries .
Restoration of food output to pre-war levels is not enough .
World population is increasing by 15 to 20 millions each year , and consumer demand for food is everywhere higher than before the war .
The answer to short-term scarcity is sustained expansion of production .
In Asia , where the food problem is of long standing , the basic difficulty is overcrowding of the land .
r ; t < ' * Throughout this document , weights are in ' metric tons .
hi Agricultural modernization is needed to increase output per acre , and alternative employment must be provided for millions who will not be required - on the land if agriculture is improved .
Even with modernized production , Asiatic countries will need large-scale food imports to obtain adequate diets .
Long-term programmes for the improvement and reorientation of agriculture are also needed in Europe .
Two safety-valves for relieving the growing pressure of world population upon the world food supply are Latin America and Africa .
Both continents are sparsely populated , with great undeveloped or partially developed land resources .
Both could produce food far in excess of their own needs .
The possibilities are as yet unexplored and uncomprehended .
A start is being made with land settlement programmes and mechanized farming .
FAO is prepared to make its services available to assist in further development .
The weak link in planning to meet the overwhelming need for greater production , both now and in the future , is the fear of surpluses .
The fear is that shortage of foreign exchange will reduce demand for imports ; that in any case demand will shrink when rehabilitation needs have been met ; or again , that synthetics will displace many farm products .
Therefore heavy investments in developing new production for export may not pay .
Anxiety about future markets inhibits all out efforts to expand production of many agricultural commodities .
Already producers of some productsnatural rubber , for examplefind their livelihood threatened .
Any international programmes for full production must include some assurance of expanding markets and reasonable prices if Governments , business , and farmers are to co-operate in carrying them out .
Intergovernmental consultation is called for in every phase of the problem - - emergency shortages , long-term expansion , commodity surpluses .
To achieve this consultation , the Preparatory Commission on World Food Proposals recommended an annual review of the situation in food and agriculture , forestry , and fisheries as a regular feature of the FAO Conference .
The first review will be held at the Geneva Conference this year .
The Commission further proposed an 18-nation council of FAO , World Food Counc4 , which would examine the changing situation at intervals between the annual reviews and advise Governments about needed adjustments .
At the first review , discussion will centre on these activities which might be undertaken by the council during the coming year Taking over international allocation of foods and fertilizers from the International Emergency Food Council , retaining its structure of commodity committees .
Ensuring maximum mobilization of food for human use in 1947/48 , including strengthening of food collection and food economy measures , and of efforts to ship the maximum amount of foods from exporting countries .
Accelerating the supply of materials needed to expand the 1948 harvest in food-deficit countries .
iv Promoting long-term agricultural development and nutritional programmes for countries and regions , and in collaborating with other specialized agencies and with the United Nations on the more general economic aspects .
Reviewing commodity situations in agriculture , forestry , and fisheries and promoting joint activity among Governments , including studies leading where necessary to commodity agreements .
In this work the council would maintain close contact with the Interim Co-ordinating Committee on Intergovernmental Commodity Agreements .
The primary decision to be made at Geneva is whether such a council is to be established to enable FAO to carry out these functions and others that may be needed in the future .

6 Agricultural Development 8 Local Surpluses 10 The Programme Review and the Council of FAO .
12 vi In accepting the Constitution of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , the signatory nations undertook `` to report to one another on the measures taken and the progress achieved in the fields of action set forth '' in the Preamble to the Constitution .
The present is not a time in which much progress toward these objectives can be recorded .
Most nations are occupied with keeping hunger from their doors .
The periodic reports , however , offer the best possible means for Governments to present the current situation in food and agriculture and the problems they face information that is needed if FAO is to be of service to them .
Member Governments were therefore urged to prepare these reports in advance of the Geneva Conference , so that they might be used in connexion with the first annual review of the world food and agriculture situation and outlook , which it is proposed should become a main feature of the Conference of FAO in accordance with the recommendations of the Preparatory Commission on World Food Proposals 1 , Altogether , 19 reports have so far been received from member Governments and others will be available before the Conference meets .
This is a gratifying response when it is remembered that such reports are a new feature in international affairs and that this is a year of exceptional political and economic difficulty .
Most of them onver a The world still faces scarcity .
In the period from July 1947 to June 1948 , food output in the deficit countries may be somewhat less than in the previous 12 months .
Although the output of potatoes , sugar , and fats `` Intergovernmental consultation on plans and programmes for agriculture , for nutrition , and for international trade in agricultural products should form an integral and important part of the regular sessions of the FAO Conference ...
We recommend that a first attempt be made to conduct such a general review at the regular 1947 session of the FAO Conference .

I. PERIODIC REPORTS 2 .
SUPPLIES IN 1947/48 1 ] wide range of subjects and many contain a wealth of valuable information which will be useful in enabling FAO to strengthen its services to Governments .
Next year it is hoped that , with more ample notice in advance , all member countries will be able to submit reports .
Material in the reports received so far has been heavily drawn upon to build a picture of the current situation and of likely developments immediately ahead .
In addition to these periodic reports , FAO has used information made available at the meetings of the Preparatory Commission and at a number of other meetings convened to discuss particular situations and important commodities , as well as statistical and other data supplied directly by Governments or collected by the Organization from other sources .
Details are given in a series of documents on special topics already circulated to Governments .
The purpose of the present review of The State of Food and Agriculture is to summarize these facts and bring out the principal issues on which the Geneva Conference will want to take decisions .
These are primarily issues of national and international policy .
A companion report previously sent to Governments the Second Annua / Report of the DirectorGeneral to the FAO Conference = was mainly concerned with the work of FAO during the past year .
The two documents should be considered together .
will probably be larger , and although a modest increase in output of livestock products may occur in certain areas , all this gain may well be offset by the fall in cereals output caused by adverse weather .
The gradual post-war recovery of world agriculture has this year received a temporary check in many regions on account of factors outside the control of man .
The export of food from surplus countries may perhaps be increased sufficiently to offset 2 FAO , Second Annua / Report of the Director-General to the FAO Conference , Washington , July 1947 .
reduced output in deficit countries , but hardly enough to bring any significant betterment in diets .
In the deficit countries , the general state of malnutrition will persist and any minor or local improvement will not much lessen the cumulative effects of prolonged deprivation .
CEREALS The cereals harvest in the Northern Hemisphere is expected to be lower than in 1946 , because of winterkill in Europe , rust in India , drought in China , and excessive rains in the United States of America .
Europe 's bread grain output may prove to be from 4 to 6 million tons lower and India 's wheat crop is reported to be down by about one million tons .
The United States of America , although harvesting the largest wheat crop in its history , expects the outturn of maize and other fodder grains to be less than in 1946 , which may mean a tight feedstuffs situation in spite of a considerable carry-over of maize .
Only in the U.S.S.R. and certain other areas of Eastern Europe is a marked improvement over 1946 to be expected .
The U.S.S.R. has announced the abolition of bread rationing and is understood to be contracting to export substantial quantities of grain during the coming year .
It is too early to predict Southern Hemisphere grain harvests , but with average weather the outturn should exceed the drought-affected level of recent years .
Likewise with rice it is too soon to predict , but some improvement is likely .
Floods have damaged rice crops in South China , but India expects a better harvest than in 1946/47 .
Japan 's harvest may even surpass the excellent one of last year .
Indo-China will probably export less but there is a prospect of improvement in Burma .
Altogether rice exports , including those from the Western Hemisphere and from Egypt , may be increased by perhaps half-a-million tons 3 .
POTATOES In many countries of Europe , the potato is the next most significant food after bread .
If weather conditions are average until harvest time , the coming crop , sown on a larger acreage , should be heavier than that of 1946/47 .
In several countries of Western 3 An up-to-date account of the world cereals and rice situation will be prepared and made available immediately prior to the'Geneva Conference .
[ 2 ] Europe , because of general food shortages , potato consumption is already well above prewar , supplies having been diverted from livestock to human use .
Further recovery in production this year , notably in Eastern Europe , should enable those peoples also to expand their potato consumption .
SUGAR World sugar supplies in 1947/48 will probably be only a little better than in 1946/47 because a substantially increased output in Europe , the U.S.S.R ., and the Philippines may be almost matched by the anticipated decline in Cuban production .
But the restoration of production in Europe ( excluding Germany ) means not only an improvement in the sugar ration but also , for many countries , a saving in scarce foreign exchange .
In the Far East , Java is unlikely to be exporting any significant quantities .
For this and other reasons , India , Japan , and Korea at present have to obtain their imports principally from Cuba and the United States .
Cuba , which during the war pushed production to phenomenally high levels to help the United Nations , may face considerable readjustment problems .
Dollar shortages and the present high world sugar price , coupled with the recovery of production in wardamaged countries , threaten to reduce the demand for Cuban sugar substantially .
Here is need for international action to seek a solution not , as before the war , by restriction but by positive programmes to remove barriers to consumption in low-consumption countries and low-income groups .
FATS Production of fats and oils continues its slow but steady improvement and supplies in 1947/48 should be better than in 1946/47 .
Because both Canada and the United States promised substantial price increases , their oilseed acreage has risen sharply and a large output is expected which may put the United States in a net export position .
Much heavier exports should come from the Argentine than in the disappointing season of 1946/47 .
Philippine copra exports will probably remain at high levels , while moderate quantities of oil may begin to flow from India and Malaya .
Mediterranean Europe is likely to have a better olive-oil crop than in 1946/47 , but over Europe as a whole the output of animal fats cannot expand much until more feedstuffs become available through import or through improvement of pasture and other indigenous fodder supplies .
If sufficient foreign exchange can be found to finance an increase in imports and if the system of allocations is maintained , consumption in most European deficit countries , apart from Germany , should reach 70 to 75 percent of pre-war consumption compared with 60 to 65 percent in 1946/47 .
In Latin America , India , and a few other exporting areas the increase in per caput consumption registered during the war is likely to be maintained , which reduces the quantities of fats and oils available for export .
LIVESTOCK PRODUCTS Output of meat and milk in 1947/48 is likely to show only a little improvement over 1946/47 because , while in Europe and the Southern Hemisphere some increase in domestic fodder crop output may be registered , a world-wide shortage of feedstuffs continues .
In Europe - - including the United Kingdom , the principal importing arealivestock numbers may increase slightly but principally in the classes of breeding-stock and young animals .
Meat output is expected to remain lowabout 60 percent of pre-warin Continental Europe .
Milk and butter output will probably be unchanged at about two-thirds of pre-war , largely for lack of grain and oilcake .
In Southern Hemisphere exporting countries where production of meat and dairy products has remained at about pre-war levels , there may be some increase in 1947/48 .
In North America , output is far above pre-war and is likely to be maintained .
Foreign trade in livestock products is largely dominated by the imports of the United Kingdom , which to a great extent are covered by long-term contracts .
Volume of imports should continue at no more than the previous year 's levels .
But imports , principally of meat and processed milk , into the countries where the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration operated will have virtually ceased with the closing of UNRRA , the countries concerned having insufficient foreign exchange to purchase such commodities at current prices .
It may be noted that there are no longer world prices for these products but rather a different price in each different contract or trade agreement .
Thus , during 1946/47 , Danish butter export prices have ranged from 4.19 ' kronen per kilogramme to the United Kingdom , up to 8.70 kronen per kilogramme [ 3 ] to Finland .
The United Kingdom paid for beef 4 to 4.5 pence per pound to Australia and New Zealand , but 21.23 pence per pound to the United States of America .
In the early summer wheat was selling at $ 1.55 per bushel within the Canada-United Kingdom contract , at $ 2.50 on the Chicago market , and at anything from $ 3.60 to $ 4.80 per bushel in Argentine contracts .
A diversity of prices , though less wide , characterizes the trade in several other agricultural products at the present time .
FISH World fish production has steadily increased since the end of the vvar but has not yet regained pre-war levels .
This recovery is expected to continue in the coming year .
Apart from Japan , France , and Germany , most of the important fisheries countries should be landing catches equal or close to the prewar quantity .
In several war-damaged countries , however , the post-war transportation shortage prevents widespread distribution of fish outside coastal areas , and these difficulties will persist in 1947/48 .
From the nutritional viewpoint , wider fish distribution would be the readiest way of augmenting the supply of animal protein which is deficient in most urban diets .
Governments of fooddeficit countries might be asked by the Geneva Conference to re-examine the possibilities of some immediate improvement in fish marketing and transportation facilities .
International trade in fish is reverting rapidly from the fresh and frozen to the canned and salted products .
Canned fish supplies for export in 1947/48 should be a little higher than in the past year , largely because of increased output in Norway and the United Kingdom .
The large Japanese contribution of pre-war is still wholly missing .
Salted cod exports in 1947/48 should be comparable with the 1935-1938 level as a result of a brisk revival of output in Scandinavia during the past two years .
Landings from the herring fisheries , which have been curtailed during and since the war , may show some improvement , but only about 40 percent of the catch goes into human consumption , the remainder being used for oil , meal , and bait .
FIBRES AND FIBRE PRODUCTS In this brief review of world supplies it is important to consider not merely foodstuffs but also the other principal agricultural products .
They provide basic necessitiesfor example , clothing and shelterand their production involves the livelihood of many million farmers around the world .
World production in 1947/48 of the five main apparel and household fibrescotton , wool , flax , silk , and rayonshould be a little higher than in 1946/47 but still considerably less than 1935-1939 .
However , carryover stocks are so substantial that the effective supply is nearly as large as pre-war .
Cotton acreage , reduced during the war in all the chief producing countries because of labour shortages or competition of food crops for the use of land , is recovering slowly .
The Russian flax and the Japanese silk industries have been disorganized by the war moreover , silk has lost a large part of its market to man-made fibres , possibly permanently .
Recovery in rayon production in Italy , Germany , and Japan is held back by lack of coal and caustic soda .
On the manufacturing side , the most widespread difficulty continues to be shortage of labour , which in a period of full employment can find better-paid work elsewhere .
Lack of fuel , power , and chemicals has also impeded production .
Between 1939 and 1947 the price of raw cotton almost quadrupled , while the price of wool nearly doubled .
Many countries find difficulty in paying for raw fibre imports , especially at current prices , although for some countries this was circumvented by arrangements to supply fibres on credit and take payment in finished textile goods for export .
The United Kingdom has already announced a reduction in raw cotton purchases , and it seems likely that in 1947/48 the overall import demand for raw fibres , particularly cotton , will decline unless financial aid is made available to deficit countries .
Consumption of textile goods remains low in many countries .
In Far-Eastern areas , consumption is still about one-half to one-tenth of pre-war .
In Europe , the output of textiles has recovered more rapidly , but in most countries consumption is still 20 to 40 percent below pre-war .
Supplies should increase further in 1947/48 , but it will be some years before the backlog can be made good .
' Ton-EsT PRODUCTS Shortage of timber will continue in 1947/48 to delay many construction projects , especially housing .
During the war , output and consumption of forest products , rose rapidly in - Canada and the United States , whilst by contrast in Europe and Japan supplies were [ 4 ] seriously curtailed .
Since the war , the timber-exporting countries of Scandinavia and Eastern Europe , producing less and consuming more , have not regained their pre-war level of exports .
This , coupled with the difficulty of financing imports from North America , especially at present high lumber prices , prolonged the acute shortage in Western Europe , the United Kingdom , and Japan .
In the United Kingdom , for example , consumption is little more than half of pre-war .
Last May at the International Timber Conference called by FAO at Marianske Lazne a programme was formulated to meet this situation .
The Conference recommended an increase in fellings by 10 percent in European countries for the next two years and the introduction of measures to control and further economize the use of timber .
It urged action to obtain for the deficit countries greater exports from Germany , the U.S.S.R ., and North America .
Pulp and paper production is well above pre-war , but the increase in both output and consumption is concentrated in North America .
Many European countries have less than half their pre-war supplies .
Europe 's output can increase in 1948 provided more coal is shipped to Scandinavian countries .
But those countries try to sell their exports in hard-currency areas rather than in the deficiency countries of Europe .
The supply of pit props has temporarily caught up with current demand while the use of plywood is expanding rapidly .
In the longer run , the world 's supply of timber can be augmented by opening up tropical forests , particularly in Latin America .
This is already commencing , but a market for the principal woods obtainable has still to be established .
The _ Conference may decide to endorse the recommendations of the Marianske Lazne Conference and ask FAO to keep its Council regularly informed , particularly as regards co-operation with the Economic Commission for Europe in handling immediate European problems , 8, nd as regards the development of forest policies in Latin America and the Far East .
RUBBER Recovery of natural rubber production in South-East Asia has been extraordinarily rapid .
At about 1.2 million tons , the world output in 1947 has already surpassed the pre-war average , while in 1948 the output will be still larger .
The native smallholdings have naturally resumed activity faster than the estates , which face labour and other difficulties .
At present , smallholdings rubber accounts for more than half the total supply .
The current output of natural and synthetic rubber already exceeds the current consumption of new rubber .
Yet in 1948 output will be larger and demand smaller , since some of the present backlog in demand will have been satisfied .
The impending danger of surpluses is reflected in rubber prices .
December futures are below 16 U.S. cents per pound and July 1948 futures approach 14 cents .
In the United States of America it has been recommended that some synthetic capacity be kept in operation and , though no quantity has yet been officially determined , total synthetic production in the United States and other producing countries is likely to be at least 500,000 tons .
This , together with natural rubber , would give a world annual output of 2.2 million tons against consumption forecast at 1.6 million tons assuming high levels of prosperity .
In such a situation , whether prices collapsed or restriction of production was imposed , serious difficulties would arise for those countries , for instance in Latin America , where during the war production was expanded at considerable cost .
Moreover , it would bring misery to the thousands of producers and their families in South-East Asia .
The possibility of dealing constructively with this problem is discussed later ( see Section 5 ) .
GENERAL FOOD BALANCE The damage caused by the war to agriculture in Asia and Europe is slowly being repaired , but adverse weather has checked the recovery in food production this year , especially in parts of Europe .
In Asia , the overall indigenous food output is likely to remain substantially unchanged compared with 1946/47 .
Thus , unless food imports can be raised , there seems little or no prospect of improvement over the highly unsatisfactory / evel of 1700-2000 calories .
In the other main deficit areanamely , Western and Central Europeindigenous food supplies are likely to be considerably smaller in 1947/48 and the already low calorie level may fall a further 5 to 10 percent unless food imports can be increased .
Fortunately , food output in the main exporting areas of the world is expected to be larger than in 1946/47 .
There should be more fats for export and more grain , espe - 15 ] cially from the Southern Hemisphere .
In addition to the usual sources of supply , the U.S.S.R. and South-Eastern Europe should have some grain for export .
It is important to form a preliminary idea of the relation between supplies and needs and of the intergovernmental efforts that may be necessary .
The Paris Cereals Conference , which met 9 July 1947 , made a first approximation by estimating possible 1947/48 grain export at 32 million tons against importing countries ' stated requirements of 50 million tons .
This latter figure , however , includes 6 million tons for livestock feed and 3 million tons for rebuilding of stocks , as well as provision for an increase in the quality or quantity of bread rations in several countries .
More modest targets will have to be set .
The matter may best be approached by taking as an objective the maintenance of cereal rations at the 1946/47 level and no more that is to say , without any restocking or reversion to whiter flour or increase in the amount of grain fed to livestock .
To accomplish this target would require 6 to 10 million tons more grain imports than in 1946/47 ; a more precise figure cannot be given until better harvest estimates are available .
This is composed of 4.5 to 7 million tons for the deficit area of Europe and North Africa , plus 1.5 to 3 million tons for Asia 4 .
Adding these quantities to 1946/47 total grain imports of 28 million tons , the minimum import requirements may be placed at 34 to 38 million tons 5 .
Supplies available for export may be tentatively estimated at 30 to 34 million tons .
Thus , even under the most favourable circumstances , it would seem barely possible to achieve the target of maintaining bread rations unless new and far-reaching action can be taken .
If , however , bread rations could be maintained it would permit a modest improvement in the calorie value of the diet in certain countries , particularly in Europe , where an increase in the supply of potatoes , sugar , and fats is to be anticipated .
4 This would include supplies sufficient to ensure the maintenance of the official rations in countries where these ve re not always honoured in 1946/47 .
In Asia the imports are required to maintain rations in the deficit regions which are cut off for lack of transportation from surplus regions , in some of which consumption levels may improve .
5 The 28 million tons in 1946/47 included some 3 million tons used for feeding livestock , but it probably will be impossible to prevent at least a similar quantity being used for feed in 1947/48 .
It is by no means certain that such high export programmes can be fulfilled .
The task confronting nations for the coming year cannot therefore be to improve the bread supply of deficit countries but rather to see what new emergency measures can be devised to ensure that the supplies are not further diminished .
Efforts must be made in two directions , as in previous years .
First , the deficit countries will need to achieve a more thorough and effective utilization of their grain harvests , as , for example , by tightening up farm collections , diverting feed grain to human use , and raising the flour extraction ratios wherever possible .
Secondly , the exporting countries may be able to take steps to mobilize maximum quantities for export and to ensure that in each month of the crop year both inland and ocean transportation is utilized to the full .
The Geneva Conference may wish to call to the urgent attention of member Governments Reinforcement of food collection , conservation , and economy measures .
Emergency steps in exporting countries to make still larger quantities of food available .
Continuation of international allocation for grain and certain other scarce foods for another year .
Although the machinery of international allocation becomes increasingly difficult to operate as the post-war food shortage drags into its third year , the situation still demands such co-operation .
The cessation of UNRRA activities in several countries coupled with accumulated exchange difficulties in others makes it indeed more necessary to maintain machinery which defends those which are in weaker bargaining positions .
Even so , there may increasingly often be instances in which countries cannot afford to take up their alloca - 3 .
PRIORITIES FOR THE 1948 HARVEST At the termination of hostilities there was a widespread desire to believe that food troubles 1 , vould shortly end .
Each year since then , many people have thought that food shortages would last only one more season until next harvest .
Consequently , very few countries have at any time taken energetic enough steps to augment the food crop of the succeeding year .
If this attitude continues , not enough food will be produced next year to ensure reasonable diets in 1948/49 .
[ 6 ] tions of essential foods .
Such a decision should be interpreted as a danger signal suggesting that the foreign exchange position of the country concerned requires overall review , and that perhaps the aid of other countries and of international agencies might need to be enlisted .
The food problem of 1947/48 is not merely a matter of a certain number of boatloads of grain , although every boatload counts .
It is a matter of saving human lives .
In Asia several countries Malaya , Ceylon , Indonesia , the Philippine Republic , Japan , and Koreadepend substantially on food imports .
Furthermore , in India and China , the principal coastal cities as well as certain other coastal regions rely heavily on imports and , for lack of transportation and other reasons , could not be supplied from the interior , however bountiful the indigenous harvest .
If imports were interrupted or curtailed , the distribution at present precariously maintained could easily break down and famine conditions ensue .
Moreover , the margin between emergency subsistence diets and actual famine is much narrower in Asia than in Europe .
Nevertheless , for Europe , too , food is a decisive factor .
The issue is whether or not 1947/48 witnesses a drift toward political disintegration or a practical start along the hard road to recovery .
If the deficit countries fail to get a minimum supply of food , then the repercussions must be faced .
- Coal production may decline further , a large part of industry may be idle during the coming winter , and social unrest may spread through the cities .
If , on the other hand , the nations severally and together can take the necessary drastic action to get food to where it is needed , then a foundation is laid on which the health and strength of the working people can be rebuilt and industrial recovery can go forward with assurance .
Extraordinary efforts will have to be made in all parts of the 1 , vorld and there must be no hesitancy no fear of producing too much .
These efforts need to be made quickly if they are to have good effect .
Already , when the FAO Conference meets , the stubbles will be being ploughed in the Northern Hemisphere for the sowing of winter grains .
To begin with , many nations could raise their wintergrain acreage goals well above present targets and aim at getting the maximum area sown between now and Christmas .
This should be followed by a similar drive early in 1948 in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres , at that time covering all food crops .
To accomplish such ambitious programmes the deficit countries must secure more equipment and supplies .
They do not have enough tractors .
The 1947/48 export supply of tractors is forecast at somewhat over 100,000 .
This quantity may not suffice and it may not be delivered in time .
Some tractors need to be delivered in the next two months and the balance not later than February .
A timely delivery programme can be organized only if Governments in supplying countries are willing to see that the necessary priorities are given to foreign orders .
More fertilizers are needed , especially nitrogen .
Evidence presented in the Fertilizers Review prepared for the Geneva Conference ( Conference document C47 / 27 ) shows that the various countries would take 3.8 million tons of nitrogen but only hope to receive 2.9 million tons .
There are plants in Europe that could produce more nitrogen if more coal were allocated to them .
There are plants in North America that are operating below capacity while some are selling liquid ammonia for less essential industrial purposes .
Supplies of potash are also uncertain .
Deliveries may be too small or too late , or both .
There is still just enough time to revise fertilizer production programmes .
If prompt action can be taken , greatly increased quantities could be delivered to farmers by February , which would be in time for the Northern Hemisphere spring dressings .
C , ertain agricultural seeds are in short supply .
In Europe this is particularly true of the biennial root crops which suffered during the severe winter .
Prompt importation of appropriate varieties , generally from neighbouring countries but in a few cases from overseas , would contribute substantially to increasing next year 's per-acre yields .
The demand for pesticides outruns the supply .
Not only are the traditional products , such as copper sulphate and lead arsenate , not being produced in adequate quantity but the new and much more effective pesticides evolved during the war are not yet available to many of the deficit countries .
Losses of cereals , rice , potatoes , grapes and other fruit have been heavy for lack of suitable materials .
A rapid survey of requirements followed by prompt placing of orders could ensure a much more adequate supply by next spring .
[ 7 ] In all this deficiency of supplies for stimulating agricultural production , the trouble lies to a considerable extent in the slowness of industrial recovery .
There could be more self-help in the provision of these supplies , particularly in the European deficit countries , if basic materials , such as coal and the chemicals , were more readily available .
More coal is needed in fertilizer production and for steel mills , more steel for agricultural machinery and implements and for restoring transportation systems , more chemicals should be allocated to fertilizer and pesticides manufacture .
But this cannot happen quickly , especially since one prerequisite is an increase of food rations for workers in coal mines and other heavy industries .
Meanwhile , supplementary supplies of machinery , fertilizer , and pesticides must be sought in other countries , which in turn raises foreign exchange difficulties .
What is wanted is emergency action by Governments acting in co-operation .
Each should state what it can do in the way of self-help and how far it can make surplus agricultural supplies available to other deficit countries .
Thereupon , a consolidated statement should be prepared showing the combined needs from external sources , indicating delivery date deadlines , and setting out the relevant financial difficulties .
For food and agricultural supplies , one group of European nations is already taking action along these lines .
In respect to European timber needs , this has been done at the Marianske Lazne Conference .
But other nations have similar needs and it is imperative that they , too , should come together in formulating programmes .
If these needs can be co-ordinated on a regional basis , taking realistically into account the delivery possibilities within the next six months , the supplying countries would be in a better position to examine what specific additional measures might help to meet the situation .
Owing to the urgency of the problem ; the Geneva Conference may wish to recommend that immediately after the session , FA.0 convene an ad hoc intergovernmental committee in each main deficit region to accomplish this .
FAO would be prepared to assist with all the information and services which it has at its disposal .
One thing stands out clearly , namely , that the world shortage of food and several other agricultural products is not , as was thought earlier , a short-time affair of one or two years .
It is stretching on through 1948 , 1949 , and perhaps 1950 .
For example , the grain deficit will continue for at least another year since the 1948 harvest , however bountiful , will not permit the abolition of bread rationing in all countries .
The report of the Rice Study Group convened by FAO in India 16 May-6 June 1947 envisages a serious rice shortage for four or five years longer .
The scarcity of fats and oils and of livestock products is likely ta last at least until 1950 .
The problem , moreover , is not merely the restoration of agricultural production in the devastated areas to its pre-war levels .
What was regarded as `` normal '' in 1939 is now inadequate .
The world 's population has increased by about 175 millions since the outbreak of the war , and every year there are 15 to 20 million more mouths to feed .
In some of the regions formerly regarded as food surplus areas , growth in industrialization has caused increases or changes in domestic food consumption and a reduction , in some cases perhaps a permanent reduction , in food exports .
In many industrially developed countries , the present high levels of employment together with a considerable measure of income redistribution have greatly increased the food demands of the low-income groups .
There is , further , the increased public awareness of the importance of improved diets and the obligation increasingly acknowledged by Governments , both in price policy and in special food distribution programmes , not merely tha t hunger must be prevented but Governments are rightly preoccupied with getting next year 's food and the materials to augment next year 's harvest .
Vitally important though that is , it is not enough .
Even the temporary shortages cannot be overcome solely by these makeshift emergency measures .
Besides , there are the longterm shortages which find expression in the chronic malnutrition of half the world 's population .
Long-term programmes for expansion of production are needed if the diet of Europeans is to be raised from 2300 calories to a desirable level of perhaps 2800 or 3000 calories .
How much more are they needed if a start is to be made on raising the dietary standards of hundreds of millions who have not at any time had more than 2000 to 2200 calories !
Such programmes must comprise arrangements whereby at the same time consumer purchasing that diets adequate in quantity and quality for full physiological development and working activity must be brought within the reach of all classes .
For these reasons nations have to plan not simply to surmount an emergency situation , but permanently to increase levels of food output .
It follows that the measures taken to combat the shortages cannot all be shortterm in character .
Many have to be long-term programmes for expansion of production which will mature over a period of years .
These raise long-term policy issues and in some people 's minds a fear of eventual surpluses .
Thus the short-run and the long-run problems have become intermingled and it will be dangerous henceforth to treat them separately .
There needs to be , as the Preparatory Commission emphasized , a single forum in which Governments can discuss all these questions of production and marketing , shortages and surpluses , in relation to one another .
The Commission recommended that opportunity be provided at the annual session of the FAO Conference and that a council of FAO be established to deal with these problems between sessions .
If at the Geneva , Conference such a council is established , it should probably be asked to take over and co-ordinate with its other activities the functions now exercised by the International Emergency Food Council .

AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT power and the output of other consumer goods expand in due proportion .
In every quarter of the globe there is need of comprehensive programmes for orderly expansion of ag , ricultural production .
For example , there are the densely populated underdeveloped countries .
In these there is desperately little land available to feed the population .
In India there is half-an-acre ( 0.2 ha .
) of cultivated land per caput , and in 40 years ' time , because of the increase in population , there will be less than one-third of an acre ( 0.13 ha .
) .
In developed countries , with comparatively high standards of farming , it takes 1.5 acres ( 0.6 ha .
) to feed a man .
It follows that in India , China , and other crowded countries , although minor additions to the cultivated area can perhaps be made , technical agricultural aid must be chiefly directed toward increasing output per unit of area .
Even if the farming standards of the most advanced countries could be reached and passed there would still be insufficient food , and to obtain adequate diets these Asiatic countries would have to become large-scale food importers .
The Government of India has published nutritional targets and is developing a plan for agriculture .
China , in her periodic report , indicates ambitious production goals .
Siam , subject to approval of her application for membership , has requested FAO to send a technical mission to advise on agricultural expansion .
The findings of the recent Rice Study Group , whose report 6 is before the Conference for consideration , emphasize the urgent need for increasing supplies of that basic food , and FAO , if the Conference approves , will take steps to provide special services for the rice-producing areas .
Owing to the rapid rate of population increase , every year 's delay makes these problems more intractable .
The revolutionary army of agricultural scientists and technicians must move in quickly .
Quite different is the case of the sparsely populated underdeveloped countries .
Here the economic problems are less intricate and the scope for agricultural expansion is large .
Vast areas of land remain unsettled , chiefly because engineers and doctors have not yet been put to work to make them habitable .
Recently , one or two projects have been launched which represent a foretaste of what can be done .
For instance , the British and French - Governments have each announced plans for large-scale mechanized cultivation of peanuts for oil in their African territories .
These programmes , if successful , will yield very substantial tonnages of oil , yet they relate to only a tiny fraction of the cultivable land .
Or again , certain Latin-American Governmentsfor example Brazil and Mexico have announced large immigration programmes which involve opening up new lands for settlement and agricultural production .
In both continents pioneering has to be undertaken .
In both there is a vast frontier to be pushed back .
The possibilities are as yet quite uncomprehended .
What is involved is large-scale primary developments of roads , railways , rivers , agriculture , and industry .
New lands have to be settled .
Sparsely settled lands could be opened for development by drainage or irrigation or disease control measures .
Both continents could o FAO , Report of the Rice Study Group , Washington , August 1947 .
[ 9 ] produce food far in excess of their needs and they could become granaries for supplying densely populated regions of the world .
But if they are to be asked to invest heavily in production for export they must have some assurance that the eventual products will be bought at reasonable prices .
They may hesitate and hold back unless the nations can develop satisfactory international arrangements for disposing of all the food that is produced .
Finally , there is a group of agriculturally more advanced countries in which also much remains to be done .
There is still scope for far greater application of scientific methods to everyday farming , for greater concentration on products which yield a high return , for mechanization and for improvement in labour conditions , for modernization of marketing and of the food-processing industries .
The French agricultural plan includes specific targets in all these fields .
All these types of programme for the different continents have as their common aim what , in the words of the Copenhagen resolution 7 , was described as `` deve / oping and organizing production , distribution , and utilization of basic foods to provide diets on a health standard for the people of all countries .
'' This central problem of development was specifically referred to the Preparatory Commission on World Food Proposals whose report is before the Geneva Conference s.
In this field the Commission reported at some length and made numerous valuable recommendations to member Governments and to FAO .
The services provided by the staff of FAO in connection with development programmes can take various forms : technical aid in the shape of missions , special regional services through which FAO can co-operate directly and continuously with administrators and technicians on the spot , and meetings of representatives of small or large numbers of Governments to study or recommend on proposals of mutual concern .
In addition FAO , as so strongly recommended by the Preparatory Commission , is prepared to cultivate every appropriate opportunity of co-operating with the United Nations and the various specialized agencies , notably the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development , 7 FAO , Report of the Second Session of the Conference , Washington , December 1946 , p. 5 .
S FAO , R , eport of the FAO Preparatory 00711.MiSSiOn On World Food Proposals , Washington , February 1947 .
the International Labour Organization , and , when established , the International Trade Organization , in regard to the more comprehensive plans of Governments for over-all economic development .
The Geneva Conference may wish to recommend that Governments which have not yet reported on the subject include in their next annual report to FAO some statement as to whether they have long-term agricultural development programmes completed or in preparation .
Furthermore , as a first step in helping to prepare the technical groundwork , the Conference ma , y approve the proposed establishment during the coming year of regional centres in the Far East , Latin America ., and the Middle East .
The Governments in each region should be able to use these centres as a forum for discussion of their food and agricultural problems .
There is a vast amount to do .
The world 's population is increasing rapidly , and food production must increase more rapidly .
Soil erosion must be stopped , waste lands made fertile , and science applied to farming and to forestry .
In all countries the production goals must be set high .
Last year FAO published in the Work / Food Survey some interim nutritional targets .
To reach these within the next 15 years world prGcluction would have to be expanded In the midst of this attack on short - and long-term scarcity , warning notes can already be heard .
It may seem untimely to talk of surpluses when shortages are lasting so long , and paradoxical to call them `` surpluses '' when hundreds of millions of people still lack many of the basic necessities of life .
Surpluses when they emerge are `` local '' and `` temporary '' in the sense that they cannot readily be sold in a particular place or at a particular time .
The people who want the product may not be able to afford to buy it , or institutional barriers may keep them from getting it .
In several quarters the view is held that agricultural surpluses are not far distant .
Shortages of foreign exchange may reduce the demand for imports .
Present programmes for expanding export supplies may lead to surpluses when the present abnormal demand of Asia and Europe begins to recede .
Some 9 FAO , World Food Sivrvey , Washington , 5 July 1947 .

LOCAL SURPLUSES o by some 20 percent for cereals , 35 percent for fats , 45 percent for meat , 100 percent for inilk , and over 150 percent for fruits and vegetables .
These may seem ambitious goals , but mankind has today the technical tools wherewith to make revolutionary changes in agricultural practice .
It is now possible to make a successful attack on the world 's poverty and malnutrition .
In bringing these tools effectively to work , mankind also has to deal with economic problems which by their nature affect many nations .
No Government acting alone is likely to be able to reach successful solutions of these problems .
Indeed , to attempt to do so is likely to exacerbate both the national and international difficulties .
FAO is predicated on another assumption .
The nations established FAO so that each country could utilize fully the experience gained by others , and could have regular opportunities for intergovernmental consultations .
The machinery is now ready to be used and a proposal has been made to strengthen it by setting up a Council of FAO .
Although the Governments are engrossed in short-term emergency issues , they cannot ignore the long-term challenge of malnutrition and poverty .
Civilization has to demonstrate that it can bring its benefits to all the peoples of the world .
of the reports from Governments show deep concern with this problem .
Indeed , these fears are already causing some Governments and farmers to tone down their production programmes to something less than maximum output .
In some countries , less than the maximum grain acreages have been sown through fear of the magnitude of readjustment that might be called for later .
In certain areas 1 , vhere fish is already in surplus , fewer boats will put to sea .
And there are the big development projects urgently needed for Asia , Africa , and Latin America , many of which may never be put in motion if this anxiety about future markets persists .
Some agricultural products are threatened by the forward march of technology .
As already mentioned , the producers of natural rubber , mostly small-scale farmers , economically defenceless , who have responded speedily to the world 's urgent post-war demand for production , find their livelihood threatened by the improvements in their own production methods and by the great technical advances in synthetic rubber .
In a similar way , silk is being displaced by man-made fibres , and cotton and wool producers may face a similar threat from a further expansion of output of these fibres .
It is easy to deal with such situations , as was done before the war , by international restriction schemes which penalize both producer and consumer .
That is a negative approach and should be resorted to only on rare occasions .
The Preparatory Commission on World Food Proposals gave much time to this question and developed a twofold answer .
On the one hand , reorientation of agricultural production must constitute the central feature of any positive programme for aiding farmers whose product has become really `` surplus '' .
Instead of paying farmers more to produce less of the surplus product , it is advantageous to the community and to the farmers themselves to find other agricultural enterprises or other occupations in which the redundant producers can turn out goods that are wanted .
The framing of a reorientation programme often poses difficult technical problems of agricultural science and practice , economic problems of fitting the new enterprises into the general market structure , and social problems of modifying long-established patterns of life .
Since all this takes time , whereas market situations may chante rapidly on account of the speed of present-day technological progress , many Governments are assisting farmers who have to cope with these problems of adjustment and reorientation .
Such problems are likely to be increasingly frequent in the future .
Where Governments wish to seek technical aid or advice from outside , FAO is now equipped to provide these services .
The second series of recommendations put forward by the Preparatory Commission concerned intergovernmental commodity agreements .
The Commission considered such agreements to be a useful type of administering machinery for dealing with surpluses .
In the Commission 's view , it is not intergovernmental agreements that are bad , but restriction .
Agreements may and should be concluded for positive purposes : to expand production , reduce costs , increase consumers ' purchasing power , and achieve a supplydemand balance at a high level .
Intergovernmental consultation is as desirable and necessary for the expansion of production as it is for dealing with surpluses indeed , surpluses are just an occasional and local offshoot of expansion and it may often be convenient to bring Governments together to deal comprehensively with both .
The importance of international action for orderly expansion as well as for surplus disposal is now recognized in the Geneva draft of the charter of the proposed International Trade Organization ( Draft Charter , Chapter VII ) .
Under the terms of that chapter , restrictions would be imposed only when burdensome surpluses or unemployment or under-employment exist or are expected to develop .
What the chapter emphasizes is the value of formal or informal commodity agreements for a wide variety of purposes .
In the case of certain agricultural products there might , for example , be no more than agreement to exchange statistical information through FAO .
There might be a joint programme of regional activities irrigation , soil conservation , crop estimating , marketing reform , nutritional education such as are contemplated , for instance , in the Rice Study Group 's report .
There may be a permanent intergovernmental study group to watch and advise on changes in the world market situation for a particular product .
Or there may be a fully elaborated commodity control agreement .
FAO can be of service in all these fields .
It will keep Governments regularly informed of changing world commodity situations , and the annual Conference will provide all members with an opportunity to discuss the issues as they arise .
The Conference can be used as a forum for the examination of many aspects of commodity problems : the expansion of production , the stimulation of consumption , the modernization of marketing .
There is advantage in examining these various aspects concurrently , whether in the annual Conference or in a study group .
For example , effective progress in achieving an expansion of production may , in many instances , depend on some guarantees and assurances being given in respect to export markets .
Conversely , the positive remedy for a condition of burdensome surplus on the international market may frequently lie in agricultural reorientation or in special programmes for stimulating consumption .
In the latter connection , the attention of the Geneva Conference is especially drawn to the proposal of the Preparatory Commission concerning special price sales .
This type of arrangement would , in the Commission 's view , `` improve the nutritional standard of recipient countries during their period of development and might avoid the necessity on the part of exporting countries of curtailing production or diverting surplus food products to non food uses .
Special price sales , although negotiated between pairs of countries , would be brought within the framework of commodity control agreements .
Provision for the possibility of such sales was made in the draft The state of food and agriculture in 1947 calls for an all out effort to increase supplies .
It requires short-term programmes to be put in hand immediately , but as the only final answer it requires for all countries and continents long-term expansion programmes , and these should include as an appendage machinery for dealing with such local surpluses as may arise .
The state of food and agriculture calls for more frequent intergovernmental consultation and over a wider range of problems than heretofore .
Co-operation is wanted not merely for such tasks as the allocation of foods in short supply or the estimation of needs of particular war-damaged regions important as these are but equally to mobilize supplies for the next harvest and to make a start on the longer-term answers to today 's shortages .
For this to come about and be effective it will be necessary to have : ( 1 ) better sources of information provided by Governments to FAO in regular communication of statistics and in periodic reports ; ( 2 ) reliable analyses of the available facts which FAO should increasingly be able to provide ; and ( 3 ) a forum in which Governments can discuss the evidence and decide on action .
It was the need for such a forum which the Preparatory Commission had in mind when it recommended the annual programme review and the establishment of a council of FAO , World Food Council .
In the words of the Commission 11 , the purpose of the programme review would be to consider '' ( 1 ) The situation and outlook for production , trade in and consumption of those agricultural commodities which widely affect the interests of producers and consumers .

THE PROGRAMME REVIEW AND THE COUNCIL OF FAO The domestic policies and programmes which member nations have adopted or intend to adopt and their effects upon the economies of other nations .
Requests submitted for initiation of special-price programmes and in all matters relevant thereto .
`` The great merit of this annual review will be that it will enable responsible officia / s of the member nations ( a ) to consider how well their respective national programmes fit together into a coherent world picture , and ( b ) to form an appreciation of hol.v far changes might be needed in national programmes or intergovernmental commodity operations to make them more consistent with one another .
'' The Preparatory Commission felt , however , that , in the present unsettled state of economic affairs , it would not be sufficient to review the world 's food and agriculture problems merely once a year .
It recognized the necessity for more frequent intergovernmental consultation and consequently proposed the establishment of a council of FAO to serve as a connecting-link between policy discussions at the annual programme reviews .
The Commission described the purposes of such a councii as being `` to keep under constant review matters within the competence of the annual programme review , and to tender advice on such matters to member Governments of FAO , to intergovernmental commodity councils , and to other specialized international agencies .
'' In particular , the council should `` ( 1 ) Examine current deve / opments in proposed and existing intergovernmental agricultural commodity arrangements , particularly those developments affecting adequacy of food supplies , utilization of food reserves , famine relief , changes in producing or pricing policies , and special food programmes for undernourished groups ; [ 13 ] Take action to accelerate the supply of materials needed to expand the 1948 harvest , including the co-ordination of needs and , if necessary , the making of special arrangements for procurement .
Assist member Governments in promoting longer-term agricultural and nutritional development programmes for individual countries and for regions , and in regard to the general economic aspects collaborate with the United Nations and various specialized agencies .
Review agricultural , forestry , and fisheries commodity situations and where necessary promote joint activity among Governments while ma , intaining close contact with the Interim Co-ordinating Committee .
No doubt in the course of time the council will develop other important activities , but these seem to be the ones demanding highest priority in the coming year .
The council and the annual programme review should enable Governments to become closely and continuously associated with the development of FAO 's work and services and should make it possible for them to exchange views on the many and varied issues of food and agriculture around the world .
In the years immediately ahead , the nations will be facing difficulties of quite exceptional character , and it is imperative to develop international procedures for handling them .
The problems v ..
hich arise on all sides cannot be left unsolved .
We can no longer afford to be defeatists about the abolition of poverty and hunger , because , were we to be defeated in this , it would be the defeat of civilization .
It is now for the first time possible to devise programmes fully utilizing the world 's expanding productive capacity for the purpose of meeting people 's needs .
Food , clothing , and shelter are the most basic of those needs and it will be the responsibility of member Governments working through FAO to meet this challenge .
Promete consistency and co-ordination of agricultural commodity policies , national and international Advise on emergency measures such as those relating to the export and import of materials or equipment needed for agricultural production .
'' 12 The Preparatory Commission thus intended the council to deal with all phases of FAO activity : the emergency short-term measures for providing needed equipment and supplies , the longer-term agricultural policies for development , and the international studies or agreements made for particular products .
For the first year it is desirable for the council to be particularly concerned with the urgent issues raised in the preceding pages .
Some issues present themselves as primarily regional in character , and the council may be able to deal with them on that basis with the assistance of the Governments of the region and of the regional services which FAO is organizing .
Others are primarily commodity issues .
The council will have to develop its own procedures to suit the various phases of its work and the changing situation .
In directing attention to the outstanding prbblems of 1947/48 , the Geneva .
Conference may wish to recommend that the council Consult with member Governments to ensure a maximum mobilization of food for human use in 1947/48 , including the strengthening of food collection and food economy measures .
Undertake on behalf of the Conference the functions now performed by the IEFC a , nd continue the international allocation of food and fertilizers in short supply , taking over the remaining IEFC Commodity Committees in order to ensure continuity .

ORIGINAL FRENCH The Sub-Commission on Mediterranean question held its first meeting at the European Regional Office of FAO in Rome from 12 to 17 December 1948 .
The meeting was opened by H.E .
Antonio Segni , Italian Minister of Agriculture and Forestry .
The following countries were represented at this conference : France ( Metropolitan France ) , Algeria , Tunisia and Morocco , Italy , Greece and United Kingdom ( Cyprus ) .
The People 's Republic of Yugoslavia and the State of Israel sent observers .
Professor Aldo Pavari , Director of the Forestry Research Station at Florence , was unanimously elected Chairman .
Mr. Challot , Conservator of forests in Morocco , was nominated Vice-Chairman and Messrs. Waterer , Conservator of forests of Cyprus and Moulopoulos , Professor of Silviculture at the Salonika University were nominated rapporteurs .
After the Chairman had recalled the important role played before the war by Silva Mediterranea for the study of Mediterranean questions , Professor Guinier who was one of the founders of this society was elected Honorary Chairman of the Sub-Commission .
The Sub-Commission provisionally adopted for its deliberations , the rules of procedure , proposed by the Secretariat , ( Document MSC 11 ) but modified Article XXXVI .
It decided that French would be the official language for the reports and documentation and that the working languages would be determinated at the beginning of each meeting .
After the Chairman had outlined the principal aims of the Sub-Commission the provisional agenda was adopted with some changes , namely postponement for discussion at later meetings at certain economic , psychological and administrative problems , included in the provisional agenda .
During a general discussion the Sub-Commission decided to concentrate its deliberations on the following items : 1 .
the importance of the land use problem and recommendations for securing international co-operation ; 2 .
the definition of the geographical regions to be included in its studies ; 3 .
technical problems , principally : a ) species and types of breeds to be introduced ; b ) measures against fires , plant diseases and insects ; c ) reforestation and soil conservation techniques .
Having outlined in these three fields the general principles to be followed , the Commission referred these questions to three working Groups for more detailed study and for the drafting of appropriate recommendations .
The Sub-Commission having heard a communication from Professor Giordano for the better use of forestry products in the Mediterranean Region , requested him to present a formal proposal for its consideration .
The Sub-Commission approved the following reports of the Working Group and the resolutions on the better use of forest products .
FAO 49.1 / 488a Med.For I REPORT OF WORKING GROUP I. IMPORTANCE OF THE PROBLEM AND PROCEDURE TO BE FOLLOWED FOR INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION .
The destruction of forest growth in the Mediterranean has everywhere been followed by deterioration in the soils and a disturbance of normal moisture relationships , which is developing at a cumulative rate .
This is all the more alarming in all the countries where population is increasing .
Despite certain variations due to local conditions as between the Mediterranean countries the forests in this general region play several important roles common through the area .
Among these the working Group considers as outstanding the following two .
The first is in the protection of the soil and the regulation of stream-flow .
The second is to provide for the needs in varying degree of the local populations in timber , fuel , and other forest products .
While the relative importance of these two roles varies as between different areas , in general the protection function must be considered as of primary importance .
To a large extent Mediterranean forests are at present in a degraded condition and the first concern must be to restore those areas primarily suited for forests .
When that restoration has been effected , the function of production of needed raw materials will play an increasingly important part in their management .
The working Group recognizes that the existing forest area in the Mediterranean countries is quite insufficient to ensure either the necessary protection of soil and water or provision of forest products needs of local populations .
The second important problem facing the Mediterranean countries is , therefore , to establish new forests through reforestation .
The necessity for survey and rough classification of land according to its best use in the national interests particularly for agriculture , fruit-tree growing , pasturage , productive forestry , or forestry in protective zones is emphasized as the first step in solving the problem .
The degraded condition of existing forests is due in large measure to unrestricted grazing , particularly by goats and sheep .
The Working Group recognizes that this condition raises the whole problem of a fundamental change in the way of life of 1arge sections of the populations .
Remedial measures can only be effected through intimate coordination of all governmental and communal authorities having to do with forestry , agriculture , pasturage , water engineering and social welfare .
Combined planning is essential and forest improvement and reforestation as the first step in soil restoration and conservation must start in local restricted areas which may serve as demonstrations , the success of which can encourage extension to cover larger areas .
Two fundamental requirements must be met if the problem of rehabilitation of Mediterranean forests is to be approached with any hope of successful solution .
One is adequate finances continuingly available over the necessary time period .
The second is social and economic stability .
Forestry measures are inherently of the long term and it would obviously be futile to embark on a continuing program under conditions wherein the whole effort might be destroyed through upheavals beyond the control of the authorities concerned in the improvement program .
FAO 49 I / 488a Med.For .
As regards the first ( adequate financing ) the cost of creating , maintaining and administering forests must be considered as an insurance against loss of soil and water and , therefore , should be recognized by Governments as a necessary commitment in annual budgets .
As indicated above , soil and water conservation demands combined techniques of forestry , grazing control , improvement of agricultural methods , and water engineering , each applied to the class of land most suited to it .
The execution of these branches of land use should be combined for administrative purposes .
Two branches of land use are most intimately connected in all Mediterranean countries .
There are forestry and free-range pasturage .
The relation is such that no permanent improvement in forestry is possible until the pasturage problem is effectively solved .
Both forestry and pasturage have two aspects : ( a ) the preservation of the vegetative cover on land which is strategic from the point of view of soil and water conservation , and ( b ) the provision of supplemental fuel and animal food supplies to relieve pressure of over cutting and overgrazing on the protective catchment areas ; this should be done by the improvement of animal food supplies and the establishment of tree crops on farm lands and other lands outside the catchment areas .
The first is mainly executive and the second is mainly advisory .
It is essential for the governments to formulate and declare their forest and pasturage policies to ensure continuity of land use and to enable effective application of such policies by the executive officers .
The Working Group urges that the principle of liberal compensation particularly in the beginning in the reduction of the number of grazing animals be recognized and it is essential to provide an alternative mode of living which constitutes the cheapest form of investment in reforestation .
The teaching of range management should be undertaken by all educational institutions engaged in the training of specialists in agriculture and forestry .
Attention is called to the need for : search in the range management in the Mediterranean basin .
The Working Group believes that the inauguration of a demonstration or several demonstration projects in the improvement of land use from unrestricted pasturage to an integrated economy paying due attention to the role of forests and tree crops , and to soil restoration and conservation generally , would be a valuable project for concerted international action under the auspices of the FAO .
The capital investments required for the rehabilitation of the comparatively restricted areas concerned would not be unduly large .
The main portion thereof could possibly be included in the budgets of the participating countries .
The Working Group is of the view that such demonstration projects would be of a nature which would fall within the categories of undertakings permitting loans by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to cover in part this capital investment required .
The Working Group therefore recommends that FAO : a ) explore with interested governments the possibility of selecting mutually satisfactory areas for demonstration ; b ) obtain the agreement of such countries for financial legislative and administrative support is required including arrangements for investigation and research by agencies FAO 49.1 / 488a Med.For interested in any land use problems arising in such areas , and c ) approach the International Bank or other appropriate international authorities for the securing of such additional funds as may be required to complete the financing of these activities .

Original French. II WORKING GROUP II DELIMITATION OF MEDITERRANEAN TERRITORY I The Sub-Commission proposed that instead of defining the Mediterranean countries , the regions over which the action of the Sub -- Commission be extended should be delimited .
It appeared advisable , before coming to item II , to give a list of countries interested in the problem through either all or part of their territory : Portugal , Spain , France , Italy , Switzerland , Yugoslavia , Albania , Greece , Bulgaria , Turkey , Syria , Lebanon , Palestine , Egypt , Libya , Tunisia , Algeria , Morocco and the Mediterranean Islands .
Countries having similar ecological conditions , such the United States ( California ) the U.S.S.R. ( South Crimea ) South Africa and Australia , were added to the list .
II The Sub-Commission considered that it was necessary to give a definition of Mediterranean countries .
It seemed that two regions ought to be delimited : 1 ) the specific Mediterranean region 2 ) the transition regions .
A.
It may be taken that the limit of the specific Mediterranean region coincides with that of the olive growing wild or cultivated without irrigation , both in the North and in the South .
B.
The transition regions in the South and the East comprise the steppe region , as far as the desert , and in the North , the agricultural and forest-pastoral regions , whose economy are closely linked with that of the specific Mediterranean region .
Each country within its own borders , will determine the 1imits to be adopted .
III The Sub-Commission proposed the following methods to differentiate the subdivisions of the two aforesaid groups : 1 .
a working method based on climatic factors , 2 .
a working method based on biological factors , 3 .
an ecological method combining all the environmental factors .
The methods which may give the best results will be the synthetic method based on the aggregate ecological factors .
1 ) Climatic Method : Its use should depend on vegetation conditions , the climatic factors which have the most direct action on vegetation , should be chosen .
A study of this kind was made by Mr. De Philippis with special reference to Italy .
Similar studies should be effected by the Sub - Commission in each country concerned .
FAO 49 I / 488a.Med.For .
Original French. 2 ) Biological Methods : This method covers two aspects : botanical and zoological .
a ) Botanical aspect : the study of the flora , that is the enumeration of the species , permits the division into botanical regions , areas , sectors , but does not appear to be of much interest for the investigations of the Sub-Commission .
Botanists , foresters , economists are mainly concerned with plant groups which , being in close relation to ecological conditions , are very valuable indicators of the environmental conditions .
The vegetation considered as an ecological indicator is the best means of comparing different regions of flora , but only when the environmental conditions are similar .
Thus , there is a marked resemblance between the landscape and economy of the Mediterranean region and these in certain parts of South Africa , for example .
b ) Zoological aspect : the study of the fauna is comparable to that of the flora and does not appear to be important for the Sub -- Commission .
3 ) Direct ecological study by the synthesis of environmental conditions This synthesis may be materialized cartographically by the superposition of simple maps , each representing one of the important factors of the environment .
The main characteristics of the method are indicated in the report of Mr. GAUSSEN .
This cartography gives the synthesis of the environmental conditions by color and the mode of placing the color represents the present plant cover as it has been modified by man .
This present condition is only one of the economic elements independent of man .
THE SUB-COMMISSION CALLED THE ATTENTION OF THE FAO DIVISIONS ENGAGED IN AGRICULTURAL AND PASTORAL ECONOMY AND SOIL CONSERVATION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF DRAFTING A MAP WHICH MATERIALIZES STATISTICAL DATA OF ALL KINDS AND WHICH COULD BE BASED ON THE 1/1 .000.000 INTERNATIONAL MAP , WITHOUT EXCLUDING OTHER SCALES .
This map would permit expressing in a concrete manner , easily read , the results of a general enquiry on the present plant resources of the world and the possibilities to change this present state .
This ecological synthesis would show the regions of the world where the environmental conditions have a similar biological resultant , which would provide scientific bases for introduction tests on plant species of economic importance .
The establishment of a map on a world scale , therefore , would appear to be particularly advantageous .
It would also permit a mere precise knowledge of the field of action of the Sub-Commission both around the Mediterranean Sea and in other countries of the world .

Original French. III WORKING GROUP III TECHNICAL MEASURES 1 ) Fires control After hearing the different reports on forest fires , the Sub-Commission requested that forest services and institutes for forest research turn their attention to the early study of : 1 .
broad-leaved species capable of acting as a check to the spread of fire in forests , 2 .
the possibility of establishing fruit-tree groves in order to interest the local inhabitants in the importance of taking part in fire control , 3 .
appropriate means of educating public with a view to limiting damage caused by the progressive and , on the other hand , desirable increase in camping and , in general , pleasure trips , requested that the forest services of the countries concerned henceforth exchange through the intermediary of the secretariat , all documentation on the present extent of the means of forest fire detection and control .
2 ) Study on varieties The Sub-Commission , considering the importance of identifying among the standard forest species , the varieties and sometimes the different specimen of exceptional quality or adapted to uncommon ecological conditions , considering , on the other hand , the importance of allowing some of those types to multiple and of testing them in localities of similar conditions , 1 .
recommended that the competent authorities of all countries concerned set up a forest seed testing service , 2 .
recommended that the forest services of the different Mediterranean countries send to the corresponding forestry research institution identification cards on all standard forest species which appear to be exceptional types either because of certain qualities or because of ecological conditions differing from the average .
The Sub-Commission also recommended that these services take as an example the `` Libro Nazionale dei Boschi da seme " kept by the Forestry Experiment Station and the Institute of Silviculture of the University of Florence , Italy , in agreement with FAO .
3 .
recommended that the forest research institutes of these countries include in their program a more thorough investigation of these types , their propagation by grafting or cuttings , particularly in regard to the poplar , and the creation of new types by hybridising and that they interchange - within the plan of the International Union of Forest Research Organizations and the International Poplar Commission-the documentation which each will have centralized , as well as specimens of types of possible interest elsewhere ; 4 .
requested the governments concerned the possibility of granting their forest research institutes the funds essential in coming out these studies .
FAO 49 I / 488a Med.For .
Recommendations concerning plant diseases 3 ) Diseases After having heard reports on the spread of plant diseases , and particularly on the present development of ENDOTHIA PARASITICA in chestnut groves which constitutes a serious danger to the world , the Sub-Commission : * passed the resolution that the countries concerned have investigations made and report to the secretariat all localities in regions formerly free from attack , where the disease appears , and that in the contaminated zones , the specimens which seem to be resistant to attack be located and studied ; * requested FAO to foster and support the research work undertaken on this disease by the Italian Government and to encourage the establishment of a National Chestnut Centre , in liaison with the International Chestnut Commission which was recommended to be set up at the 4th Session of the FAO ; * requested FAO , within the general measures already advocated to prevent and check the spread of plant diseases , to assist in reinforcing and unifying frontier plant health services .
4 ) REAFFORESTATION AND SOIL RESTORATION Following an exchange of views on technical problems of reafforestation and soil restoration , and having recognized that it was practically impossible to entering into a detailed comparison of the different methods employed , the Sub-Commission : A ) recommended the Governments to instruct their technical services and forest research institutes : 1 .
to carry out investigation on the control of the surface erosion and gully erosion and not to consider reafforestation as a purely economic problem , but as a means of soil and water conservation ; 2 .
to 1imit the reforestation properly called to purely forest land and to apply to land suitable for other uses soil restoration practices based on the same principle of protecting slopes and regulating stream-flow ; 3 .
before beginning reforestation work , to study beforehand the ecological conditions of the stations , the possibility of perpetuity and regeneration of the forests which are established and the construction of a network of forest tracks for timber removal in the event of the forest being exploited .
B ) recommended the Governments of the countries concerned - in view of the special importance , in the Mediterranean countries with the progressive increase in population , of the problems regarding soil conservation and restoration - to allocate their forest services sufficient funds for the rapid extension of their investigations and the necessary execution of their projects .
FAO 49 I / 488a Med.For .
IV MOTION ON BETTER UTILIZATION OF FOREST PRODUCTS Considering that : 1 .
Soil protection cannot be viewed as the sole objective in reafforestation since , among other there is the matter of production , in timber or other products , which will be obtained in the future ; 2 .
As regards this production , it is not only the question of obtaining the maximum quantity , but particularly of obtaining products of quality ; 3 .
In the case of exotic varieties employed for reafforestation , it is not enough to know their technological characteristics as regards timber and other products in the countries of origin as cultivation in other zones may lead to very appreciable variations .
the Sub-Commission : a ) calls the attention of all the Mediterranean countries to the necessity of carrying out systematic investigations on the technological aspects of production of timber or other products either through new plantations or from wild forests about which little as yet is known ; b ) recommends that FAO provides effective support in order that the results obtained in the most important cases may be assembled , studied and made known to all countries .
Among the technological problems to be studied , the Sub-Commission mentioned : I.
The practice of tapping the Mediterranean pines and its effect on the characteristics of wood , timber output , seed production , etc .; II.
The possible uses of eucalyptus wood ; III .
The characteristics of the wood of central European or exotic conifers cultivated in the Mediterranean region ; IV .
Improvement of cork production .
DOCUMENTATION COLLECTED BY THE SILVA MEDITERRANEA The Sub-Commission considering that the documentation collected between the two world wars by the Silva Mediterranea Association constituted a firm basis for its future activity .
It therefore requested the Secretariat to assemble this material and prepare a catalogue thereof for distribution to interested experts .
The Sub-Commission emphasized the importance of the bibliographical questions in this field and recommended that FAO , in close collaboration with the International Union of Forest Research Organizations resume the bibliographical activities which were in progress before the war .
FAO 49 I / 488a Med.For .
MISSION AND STUDY CONCERNING THE MEDITERRANEAN BASIN The Sub-Commission took note of the recommendation placed before the annual conference of FAO that expert missions should visit the Mediterranean countries to study the most urgent problems .
The Sub-Commission strongly supports this recommendation and requests the Director General of FAO to arrange such missions as soon as possible .
Delimitation of the Mediterranean regions The Sub-Commission requested its experts to continue their work on the delimitation of the countries interesting the Sub-Commission , if necessary consulting other experts , and to report on the results of their investigations at the next meeting .
Distribution of the report The Sub-Commission recommended that the attending Delegates present this Report without delay to their respective Governments and that it be forwarded to the Director General and Council of FAO by the Chairman of the European Commission on Forestry and Forest products with a request for former transmission to the member countries of FAO .
Documents prepared for or presented at the meeting .
The Sub-Commission expressed its satisfaction to the different rapporteurs for the reports which were prepared for the meeting or which were presented during the meeting and requested that they be appended to the Final Report which will be addressed to the members of the Sub-Commission .
Statement of the State of Israel Observer The Sub-Commission took note of the statement of the Observer from Israel expressing the desire of that state to collaborate in the solution of the special forestry problems of the Mediterranean countries .
Date and Place of next meeting The Sub-Commission considered that it should meet at least once every two years and preferably in the springs .
It entrusted the Chairman , Vice-Chairman and the Secretariat with the task of organizing the next meeting , after consultation with the experts concerned .

For the first investigations on physical and chemical oceanography in the Indonesian Archipel a p , we have .
to go back to the years 1872-76 , when the British Exvlorer `` CHALLENGER made her famous cruise around the world .
Many cruises conducted by several nations followed , but all these expeditions had the same aim : exploitation of all means of oceanographic and biological interest , from a purely scientific point of view .
The establishment of the '' VISSCHERIJ STATION `` ( Fisheries Station ) at Batavia , in the year 1905 , was the first step in real activity in oceanographic survey .
The aim of this institution was : Investigation of problems of the Indonesian waters from a scientific as well as from a practical point of view .
With the Government steamvessel '' GIER `` , many extensive cruises were made to try out the possibilities of trawling in Indonesian waters .
In 1914 Capt K. M. van Wee1 started his first systematic survey of the Java Sea .
During this survey special notice was taken of salinities , densities and temperatures , the horizontal and vertical distributions of these properties and their seasonal changes .
The plotted results : g f these investigations are on file but the data are lost .
This survey was ended in Aunust 191F .
This first oceanographic survey was followed up by an extensive survey during 1917-20 , covering the areas of the Java Sea , South China Sea , and Malacca Straits .
This survey again was conducted by Capt. K. M. van Weel , who published his results in '' Treubia `` May 1923 '' Meteorological and Hydrographical Observations , made in the Wcstern part of the Netherland East Indian Archipelago .
`` Many charts showing the distributions of salinities , densities and temperatures accompany this publication .
A full interpretation of the results of Capt van Weel 's survey was published by Dr. H. P. Berlage Jr ., in 1927 '' Monsoon-currents in the Java Sea and its entrance `` .
From 1920 oceanographic work came nearly to a standstill , but in 1939 a new start was made .
A shiv was made available bv the fisheries department for oceanographic work and was run for the Laboratory .
Under Capt Veen 4 cruises were made yearly covering Sunda Straits and the Java Sea up to the 200 meter line in the Macassar Straits .
These cruises were made during the West and East Moonsoon and during the two changes .
Water samples were taken from surface to bottom , currents measured , temperatures noted , transparency measured with Secchi disc , etc. Water samples were analyzed at the Laboratory a t Batavia for salinity .
With the cooperation of the Koninkiijke Paketvaart Maatschappij surface water sampIes also were taken on board ships running on regular lines crossing the Java Sea , Sunda Straits or Macassar Straits .
Also many lighthouse-keepers collected weekly watersamples .
Dr. L. Van Dam entered the Laboratory as oceanographer and worked out a method of micrachlorine titration , which is described in .
'' TREUBIA `` Nr 17 , Dec 1940 '' Estimation of Chbride in 1 cc seawater sample by means of syringe pipettes .
`` This method saved us lots of trouble during wartime , when silver nitrate was very scarce and costly .
The activities of the Laboratory came to a sudden end with the outbreak of war with Japan in December 1941 .
Not before July 1947 the Laboratory came in our hands again , but i t took a long time to arrange and tidy the mess that was left over from the time of occupation and turmoil .
Very fortunately we found .
all oceanographic data back and complete .
These data will be worked up as soon as possible .
Activities in the Laboratory are in full swing again .
Thanks to the cooperation of the Koninklijke Paketvaart Maatschappij and their Captains and oficers surface samples and temperatures are collected on about 30 ships running on regular lines from Medan to Hollandia and Merauke .
We also mention the cooperation of the Department of Shipping and Navigation and their Lighthousekeepers , who weekly collect surface samples on about 30 offlying lighthouses .
Rehabilitation of the Laboratory is nicely under way , orders for equipment , chemicals and glassware have been placed .
A seagoing lainch of about 40 feet is on the way to completion and most probably will be delivered in April .
In collabotation with the Fisheries Department plans are worked out for a seasonal investigation of the seas lying around North Cel.bs and Gilolo ( Halmaheira ) for which survey the Fisheries Department will try to make available a ship as soon as possible .

The chief source of collated information regarding the Fisheries of India is the official ~ ublication of the Government of India , Ministry of Agriculture entitled the `` Report on the Marketing of Fish in India '' ( Manager of Publications , Delhi , 1946 ) .
This is a compilation of the Marketing Department ( of the Government of India , Ministry of Agriculture ) which collected information from various sources including a large number of fishermen , fish-curers , merchants and fishery officials and others .
I t will be seen that this compilation reveals that no real scientific effort had been made hitherto in Indian waters to estimate effectively the extent of bottom or pelagic fisheries with the help of suitable craft , more particularly the small deep-sea fishing boats , danish seines , long lines , etc. suited for fishing in sub-surface or mid waters which may be expected to yield commercially adequate catches of prime and other fish .
Trawling experiments in the Bay of Bengal , the Arabian sea and the Gulf of Manaar have revealed that the catches conAed of a large proportion of Elasmobranchs and Percomorphid genera some of which can be classed only as bottom-feeders .
Such statistics as have been collected by the Marketing Department reveal that herrings and anchovies , mackerel and perches , and prawns , all pelagic fishes-hold the first three places in the pelagic fisheries of India ' followed by a group of miscellaneous mid water fish including jew-fish , silver bellies , Bombay duck , Pomfrets , Indian salmon , mullets , and silver-bar .
The fact that some or all of these pelagic forms and the bottom-feeding sharks and rays , cat-fishes , and soles have been obtained in the course of the trawling experiments reveal that there is a certain degree of intermingling of the so-called bottom and pelagic fishes in Indian waters .
As far as one can judge from the craft and gear employed hitherto to exploit fishery resources in our waters , i t would appear that the exploitation of the resources , particularly in reference to the pelagic fisheries , has neither been on the right lines m r adequate .
3 MARINE FISHERIES OF INDIA RESOURCE The chief source of collated information regarding the Fisheries of India is the official ~ ublication of the Government of India , Ministry of Agriculture entitled the `` Report on the Marketing of Fish in India '' ( Manager of Publications , Delhi , 1946 ) .

As far as one can judge from the craft and gear employed hitherto to exploit fishery resources in our waters , i t would appear that the exploitation of the resources , particularly in reference to the pelagic fisheries , has neither been on the right lines m r adequate .
ENVIRONMENT The estimated annual figures of seafish on our coast ( 11,666,000 mds .
or 933,280,000 lbs .
) for an exploitable area of 115,000 sq .
miIes ( 100 mas .
or 8,000 Ibs .
per sq .
mile ) may be unimpressive when compared to the production figures of other countries of much smaller size , but the geograpraphical and meteorological features of the country and what little is known of the oceanography of the Bay of Bengal , the Indian Ocean and the - Arabian sea suggest that the environment for fisheries in the coastaI belt up to the 100 fathom lines is likely to be favourable .
If improved methods of estimation were adopted on a much larger .
scale than has hitherto been possible and the existing fishing craft were mechanised , making i t possible to use larger and improved fishing gear in a wider range of environment , i t seems likely that our fishable waters would show themselves to be more prolific and capable of being exploited all the year round to provide an unfailing source of supplementary food to the majority of our population who would eat it , if available and within che range of their income .
' The chief agents of exploitation on our coasts are the fishing communities whose socio-economic status , being much below that of even our agricultural communities , would need to be raised considerably by governmental and other agencies before the exploitation process can be quickened .
Estimation of resources will be greatly assisted by helping to raise their socio-economic status .
There is , however , scope for undertaking the estimation by other means such as summoning the aid of theNavy , the Merchant .
Fleet , and employing specially fitted research vessels as in some S. East Asia countries .
METHODS OF INVESTIGATION In view of the almost total absence of wellequipped and modern Marine Biological Laboratories along the Indian Coasts to study the biology of fish and the physical environment in which they live , i t was found necessary by the Government of India to establish as part of their fishery development programme a Marine Fisheries Research station on the S. East Coast of India with three sub-stations on the W. Coast to study the biology of the more important species of commercial fish common on the two coasts .
The main station , now temporarily located in the University Biological Laboratories , Madras , will be more or less permanently housed in the altered and renovated Naval hospital buildings a t Mandaparn ( S.I.Rly .
) .
on the Gulf of Manaar as soon as they are ready for occupation in a few months .
Within a radius of a hundred miIes from this station exist different types of sea and backwater fisheries which include a large variety of pela - , gic , reef-dwelling and bottom fishes .
Harbour facilities for vessels with a draft of up to 10 feet are available during the S.V .
and N.E .
monsoons in the vicinity of Mandapam on either side of the Pamban causeway which divides Palk Bay from the Gulf of Mapaar .
The Central Fisheries Research Station is situated within a mile from the Mandapam Camp station of the S. Indian Rly .
main line connecting Madras with Colombo .
There is a considerable indigenous fishing population , with traditional fishing craft and gear , scattered in coastal villages south and north of Mandapam , some of them served by second class roads .
The Fisheries station will consist of several sections dealing with the chemistry of sea-water , physiology of fishes , marine biology including bacteriology , fishery biology , and fishery training .
Separate laboratories are being provided for each of these .
A rowing boat and a small para & n-engined 22 ft. motor boat for inshore work will form part of the equipment .
A separate aquarium with 14 small and 6 big tanks for observation , with running sea and fresh water is being built .
The Physiology roam is being air-conditioned and provided with , a vibration-proof room for experimental work .
A dark room for photography , a library and a small museum are also being provided in the existing buildings .
Temporary residential accommodation will be provided for the staff in the buildings until permanent quarters are constructed .
Until electric power from the Pykara mains becomes available , a separate generating set is being provided for the station .
A supply of freshwater from the Ceylon Government Quarantine Camp is expected to be available by the time the Station buildings are ready for occupation .
As the sardines , anchovies , mackerel and perches constitute the major part of the pelagic fish p rduction on our coasts , more particularly on the west coast where totally different geographical and meteorological conditions prevail , three sub-stations have been established a t Bombay , Calicut and Karwar , separated from one another by a distance of about 300 miles .
Bombay is the headquarters of the Fishery Survey Section in charge of the Fishery Officer , who is assisted by a Statistical Officer and Fish Taxonomist .
The work of the survey section relates to a more detailed estimation of our fishery resources than has hitherto been possible a t representative centres along the east and west coasts of the Indian Union territory .
The entire Indian coastal area is divided into twelve somewhat unequal zones , each in charge of a trained graduate survey assistant conversant with the local languages and fishery conditions .
Each assistant is reauired to visit the more important fishing centres in his zone every month and record information on ( 1 ) qualitative and quantitative composition of the catches of a single fishing unit , ( 2 ) number of men , craft and gear employed and the duration of effort , ( 3 ) distance from shore and depth , ( 4 ) meteorological conditions , ( 5 ) ranges of size and weight of fish , ( 6 ) proportion of sexes and sexual maturity , and ( 7 ) and other biological facts .
These data collected over a period of one year may be expected to provide on statistical analysis a reliable guide to the estimation of our fishery resources .
I t is considered essential that information should be obtained from our navy and merchant vessels regarding the movements of shoals of fish in off-shore waters and high seas , and the currents and meteorological conditions .
They could also be requested to obtain and preserve samples of sea water , plankton and fish to serve as a guide w the movements of shoals of fish .
In the absence of a well-equipped sea-going research vessel in Indian waters , the data collected by the navy and the merchant fleet would be of the utmost value .
The mackerel fishery on the west coast has been seasonal between Mangalore and Ratnagiri , and large catches are obtained between October and February and cured in various ways for export to the intericr and to Ceylon or sold fresh preserved in ice in the Bombay market .
There are at present no reliable data of any kind regarding the widespread movements of the enormous shoals of mackerel on the west coast and the whereabouts of these shoals in the off-season .
Work relating to the biology of mackerel has been taken up by the Fishery Biology section both at the Calicut and the Karwar substations where investigating staff have been stationed .
The food , growth , sexual maturity and age of mackerel are a t present being studied , but until extensive tagging experiments are undertaken the clue to the movemenis of mackerel cannot be obtained .
The restricted nature of fishing for mackerel in inshore waters .
the lack of fast fishing or other `` craft to follow shoals when sighted , and the ignorance of fishermen who have to be educated to understand the significance of scientific experiments and observation preclude the possibility of studying migrations of mackerel by tagging methods in the near future .
Nevertheless , an early attempt will be made to commence tagging experiments of some of the shoaling species .
When fast mechanised fishing craft are available on the west coast , the following and cawhing of shoals of sardines will perhaps be rendered easy .
Its sporadic appearance in small numbers in inshore waters and rarely in bigger shoals is almost a certain indication that the revival of the sardine fishery will be a distinct possibility with the increase in the number of mechanised fishing craft and the wide range of concerted fishing operations .
Growth and maturity of the oil-sardines are at present being studied at Calicut .
The status of the fisheries for prime fish which have a large consumers ' demand in all metropolitan markets is a t present not clearly known .
Reports of the occurrence of shoals of Bonito ( Thynnus ) , Barracuda ( Sphyraena ) , Seer ( Cybium ) , Indian salmon - ( Polynemus ) , Pomfrets ( Stromateus ) , Jew-fish ( Sciaena ) , in Indian waters are often received from sailors , but no true estimate of these reports can be formed without proper verification of records in regularly maintained log books of ships .
Until large mechanised fishing craft begin to operate in off-shore regions with suitable gear and tackle , the volume + of such records cannot be expected to increase and form the basis for future plans of exploitation .
In addition to the prime fish mentioned above , shoals of varying sizes of the following species have been known 30 occur on our coasts in in-shore and deep sea regions off the mainland and ^ the Andaman and Nicobar groups of islands : - Whiting ( Sillago ) , silver-billies ( Equacla , Gerres , Gazza ) , Ribbon fish ( Tricbiurzls ) , Gar-fish ( Belone & Hemhhamphus ) , silver-bar ( Chirocentrus ) , flying fish ( Cypsilurus ) , flat-fishes ( Cynoglossus , Psettodes , Plagusia , & Pseudorhombus ) , mullets ( Mugil ) , Bombay ducks ( Harpodon ) , prawns ( Penaeus , Metapenaeus , Leader ) , lobsters ( Scyllarus & Thenus ) .
I Sharks .
saw-fish .
skates .
ravs .
eels and catfishes , , , also constitute an important part of our commercial fisheries on our coasts .
Some of these are used as food by the poorer classes of people , but there is ample scope for better utilisation of the by-products of these fisheries .
The scope of shell-fisheries on the mainland of India in the island territories of the Andamans and Nicobars and the Laccadives is vast , but a judicious exploitation of these resources can be based only on fuller information being available on the biology of these fish .
The following concise report on the biological , hydrological , physiological , and survey work of the Marine Fisheries Research station will serve to give a bird 's eye view of the activities of the station .
CENTRAL MARINE FISHERIES RESEARCH STATION , MADRAS .
FISHERY BIOLOGY ( a ) Fish : The chief activities of this section are being conducted at the main and the three substations a t Calicut , Karwar and Bombay .
The work at the main station centres round marine biology in addition to the biology of sharks and rays , ribbon fish , prawns and crabs , oysters and clams , and sea - weeds , and at Calicut round herrings ( sardines and anchovies ) and mackerel and other fish of lesser economic importance ( cat-fish , Indian salmon , perches , jew-fish and flat fish ) and the plankton ( zoo - and phyto - ) on which they feed , at Karwar round mackerel and at Bombay round Bombay-duck .
INVESTIGATIONS A T CALICUT : Apart from periodical exmination of commercial catches in Calicut and the other chief fishing centres along the Malabar coast , fish and plankton collections are made on alternate days , at Calicut by the departmental fieldmen to maintain a systematic record of catches with a view to determine the relative abundance of various species and size at maturity .
These records as well as those maintained by the Madras Fisheries Department show that practically all species of food fishes have more or less definite peak periods of occurrence in coastal waters .
When species occur in great abundance and our own catches are good all the specimens are sorted , , measured and weighed and recorded in a fish register maintained for the purpose .
They are systematically examined for stomach contents , gonads and parasites and the results entered in the register .
A quantitative analysis of food organisms is also being undertaken to correlate i t with the relative abundance of such organisms in plankton collections .
A more precise appraisal of the conditions of the gonads based on the method of maturity scales adopted by the International Council for the exploitation of the Sea is being undertaken .
The well-known method of determining growth in fishes by certain ring markings in the scales and otoliths of various temperate species of commercial fish is being tested in the case of our species .
Periodic rings ( 1-2 , rarely three ) have been noticed so far only in the oil sardine ( Sardinella lungiceps ) .
In addition , variations in fin formula , body proportions , stomach contents , sexes , gonad condition of the four species of sardines common on the West coast are being recorded .
A systematic record of the occurrence of different types of fish eggs and larvae found in the plankton is being maintained .
Eggs of the sardines ( S. longiceps & Kowala thoracata ) , the anchovy ( Stolejhorus tri ) and the horse mackerel have so far been identified , and all relevant details regarding time , place , weather , currents , etc. with reference to these are being recorded .
SARDINES : In A u g y t and September , readily extrusible transparent eggs were found in mature oil-sardines .
A large shoal of oil-sardines was seen early in December off Calicut and 384 specimens were collected .
Oil sardine eggs collected from the plankton were reared in the laboratory till the larval development up to the complete absorption of the yolk had been followed .
The development of the white sardine egg is also being investigated on the same line .
MACKEREL : At Karwar , mackerel had been obtained only rarely in the monsoon season .
.
In June and July 1948 a few large gravid females ( 20-25 fms .
) were observed .
No mackerel were recorded in August while in September they were caught frequently in mixed shoals with Clupea jmbriata .
From September onwards specimens 10-1 5 cms .
long were caught daily in small numbers .
Occasionally larger sizes up to 20 crns .
were being sold in the fish market .
From October onwards shoals of mackerel ( 14-16 crns .
) were quite common in the Karwar Bay , but in.November larger mackerel ranging from 16-18 crns .
were seen in commercial catches .
Diatoms and copepods , and occasionally sand grains and fish scales ( showing that i t is occasionally a bottom feeder as well ) have been seen in the stomach contents .
Advantage of the occurrence of large numbers of mackerel in the season has been taken to initiate racial studies based on skeletal and external characters .
This is being pursued as a side-line study on holidays with a view to elaborating i t when the results show any promise of being used for distinction of races .
SHARKS & RAYS : The occurrence , distribution , seasonal abundance , general habits such as migraticn , shoaling and constitution of shoals , breeding season , sexual maturity , early life-history were studied in the more important shark-fishing centres of the S. East coast of Madras presidency , between Tuticorin and Dhanushkodi , and the latter and Adhirampatnam , Records of the nature of the bottom , depth of the sea and distances from shore , the season of occurrence , the craft and gear used in catching various species , the number of species and individuals of both sexes of each species , candition of gonads and of uteri and claspers , measurements of individuals , external and internal parasites are being maintained .
Species of Scoliodon , Carcbarias , Sphyrnu , Pristis , Myliobatis , Rhinoptera and Trygon constitute the heaviest catches of off-shore fishing in all the centres of fishing .
Shoals of sharks , rays and skates are usually unispecific , unisexual , and unidimensional and this is noticeable more particularly in boats bringing unispecific shoals .
This kind of grouping is at times too pronounced to be explained as the result of chance .
Excess of males over females was noted in sbme species .
When the entire uterine contents of single specimens are examined , the embroys of both sexes are found in more or iess equal numbers .
Ybe segregation of sex according to size seems to take place after birth .
This is an interesting phenomenon which requires further study .
Embryological and developmental studies in Scoliodon walbeehi , observations on the gestation of Trygm uarnak , Hypolophus sephen , and Pteroplatea micrura have ' been made .
RIBBON-FISHES : Since among the three species of Tricbiurus occurring in Indian waters , T. baumela appears to be the most common , the biologicil observations made on ribbon fishes refer to this species .
The feeding and breeding habits have been studied .
These habits reveal that the species feeds on different species of the smaller forms of fish including its own kind , prawns and cuttle fishes.and that the feeding activity as judged from the quantitative study of its stomach contents is highest from July up to February and that this .
period coincides with the spent condition of the gonads .
From March to June when the shoals move off shore , the choice of food seems to be restricted to the smaller species of fish such as Stolepborus , Equula , Gazza and of the prawn Acetes .
Maturity seems to be attained when the ribbonfish of both sexes reach a size of 47 - 48 crns .
in length .
The wide range of data collected on the size of individuals and of their gonads has enabled the classification of the stages of maturity-not into the seven-stages of maturity of the International Council for Exploration of the Sea-but into 5 stages , as the process of maturation starts only when the fish grow to a .
size of 4 7 4 8 crns .
Stages IIIV .
of I.C.E.S .
appear to be compressed in the present stage 3 , which may be designated '' mature `` .
The spawning condition ( Stage IV of the I.C.E.S .
) has not yet been observed .
The mature egg is 1.1 mm .
in diam .
and is found only ip individuals 48 crns .
long .
~ r o m the fact that ribbon ' fish do not appear in general catches from March to June , but begin to appear with spent gonads from July onwards i t may be inferred that shoals move away from coastal to deeper waters for spawning and come back to shallow coastal waters for feeding .
The study of the ' duration ^ of the spawning period by measurements of the intra-ovarian eggs by Hickling & Ruttenbergh 's method has been continued .
( b ) She11 Fishery : ( 1 ) .
Crustacea .
PRAWNS & CRABS : Penaeus indicus in Puli-at Lake provides a stakenet fishery throughout the year except when i-ains fail and the connection with the sea is cut off temporarily .
In Ennore and Adyar the bar remains closed for the major part of the year .
Influx of young forms ( 26 - 30 mm .
) into the Lake in August , October and November after the rains was observed .
They generally congregate in shallow regions where algal growth is abundant .
Breeding presumably takes place in July and Sept. and post larval forms migrate into the lake from the sea .
Fishermen assert that prawn-fishing in April and June at the mouth of the bar during low tides is highly productive yielding boat loads of prawns in a few hours-suggesting mass-migration into the sea from the lake presumably for purposes of breeding .
Harpacticid copepods and bottom debris of sand and vegetable matter form the main constituents of food-of the prawns , suggesting their bottom-feeding habit .
They do not seem to breed in the backwater judging from the study of the gonads which are never mature .
In Ennore prawns do noi occur from July to October when with the commencement of the monsoon showers and lowering of salinity a sudden influx of large numbers of big-sized prawns takes place .
In Adyar-P .
indicus and M. Mbmceros alternate in abundance in the months of March and August and in April respectively .
In October with the opening of the bar there is an influx of young prawns of 3 1 - 35 msn .
In Ernakulam-M .
dobsoni predominates in November .
Larval development of the common Penaeids of Madras : Pre-mysis and post-mysis stages are never available in appreciable numbers .
Larval and early post-larval stages of P. indicus , P. carinatus , M. nconoceros , dobsoni , brevicornis and Trachypenaeus were studied .
Colour has proved a reliable criterion for distinguishing Metapenaeus sp. I t has been possible to study the early rate of growth of prawns in all the stages for a period between 6 to 13 weekswhich makes it possible to estimate roughly the age of smaller prawns in commercial catches .
The last phyllosoma stage of 2 species of lobsters-Thenus orientalis and Scyllarus and the megalopae of Macrophtbalmus , Charybdes and Tbalamita have also been reared to the stages at which identification is certain .
The rate of growth of Neptunus pelagicus from its megalopa stage was observed to be rapid under labratory conditions in a period of 8 weeks .
Biology of M. dobsoni .
Material collected from the Cochin backwaters in November showed that they were 13-14 weeks old and probably hatched in August .
They seem to appear suddenly in large numbers in the backwaters when they are 20-25 mm .
long .
I t is possible that they migrate from the sea when they are of this size or even smaller .
Whether the larger forms in the backwaters are actually migrants from the sea or have grown to this size in the backwaters has yet to be ascertained .
No mature female has yet been obtained from brackish water .
I t probably matures only in the sea .
The male seems , however , to differ in that fully developed spermatophores have been fobnd in specimens of 5 5 - 70 mm .
( 2 ) Molluscs-Oysters & Clams .
CLAMS ( Meretrix casta ) : Growth , life-history , feeding habits and food value of this clam were studied .
Growth was studied by ( 1 ) measuring marked clams periodically ; ( 2 ) measuring population samplcs in definite marked areas ; ( 3 ) rearing clams under laboratory conditions .
For want of circulating water , the last named experiment in growth proved a failure and no growth was registered even after six months .
The results of I and 2 show that M. casta has a very high rate of growth in the younger forms-I $ mm ., 7 mm ., and 5 mm ., in the lst , 2nd and 3rd months , and thereafter growth diminishes rapidly till the 32 mm .
stage and becomes static at the 48 mm .
stage .
The differences in g o w t h in length and breadth persist till the 48 mm .
stage is reached when growth is equal .
The rates of growth seem to vary with localities subject to rate of flow of currents of water .
Salinity seems to have little influence on growth .
The rate of survival of clams based on incidence of sexual maturity and the seasonal changes in the gonadial follicles was studied .
The size of clam in which sexual products are first - seen is 9 mm .
in length , but maturity is not reached till 15 rnm .
size is attained when i t is about a month old .
This phenomenon of very early maturity in life coupled with a very rapid growth in younger stages is the main reason which enables the clams to survive a t Adyar in spite of intensive fishing in the area .
Veligers reared under laboratory conditions settle down in about 40 hours and the larval stage is short .
The feeding by ciliary mechanism is elaborate and complicated and the course of the food from the time they enter the inhalent siphon to the intestine has been determined .
The f & d takes less than three hours to pass through the entire alimentary canal .
Chemical analyses of these clams show.that they are as good as oyster in their food value having a fairly high glycogen content of ' 7.92 .
The + immense clam resources of Cochin backwaters are subject to serious mortality consequent on the sudden lowering of salinity by monsoon rains .
This is preventible when regular farming methods are adopted .
by regulating flow of fresh water into the clam beds .
OYSTERS : The spawning , early development and growth of spat of the backwater oyster ( Ostrea madrasensis ) are being studied in Pulicat , Ennore backwaters and in the Laboratory both from adult and larval oysters .
Spawning was observed to occur twice a year in March and April and again in November and December and the first stimulus to collective and simultaneous spawning in any given locality is usually given by a single individual .
Artificial stimulation for spawning has been successful only in the months in which there was natural spawning , i.e. in March and April and in November and December .
The gonadial condition of oysters in different seasons was studied from microscopic examination of serial sections .
The cycle has been noted as follows : fully or partially spent in March and first half of April ; spent in the latter part of April and May ; in a stage of recovery from June to September ; full in September , October and partially spent.in the latter part of November and in December .
The salinity range for spawning in backwaters has been determined to be between 20 and 21 parts per mille and the temperature between 26.0 '' C. and 27.T degrees C.
The early development of the oyster has been traced under laboratory conditions from the segmenting egg to early shelled veliger , the period of development ranging from 24 hours in summer to 46 hours in December ' .
' Larvae of the same species of oyster were collected from the Madras Harbour throughout the year with peaks of occurrence in April , October and November showing that under higher salinity conditions of the sea breeding trends to be more or less continuous .
The ' stages from free-swimming Jate oyster larvae to spat has been attempted for the first time .
An oyster reared from the larval stage is now 4 months old and 11 x 13.7 mm .
in size and has been fed upon a suspension of clam meat with a trace of calcium phosphate .
After fixation of the larva , growth is rapid up to 6 mm ., beyond which it slows down .
Experiments on the relative merits of various types of spat-collectors have not been successfui in the Adyar backwater and in the harbour owing to the place selected for experiments being unsuitable .
PARASITOLOGY Systematic examination of fish for Protozoa , Platyhelminths and Crustacean parasites has been made .
The largest numbers of infectisns are of Trematodes ( 98 % ) , Nematoda and Protozoa ( 70 ) , Cestodes approximately ( 44 % ) and Copepoda ( 27 % ) .
A new genus of Opisthocotylea has been found , Gast ~ oco t ~ lo ides indica gen , e t .
sp. nov .
MARINE BIOLOGY The standardisation of field collections , analyses of sea-water and its contents and of methods of estimating the productivity of waters , the construction and standardisation of gear and methods of marine biological work have been undertaken during the last quarter .
The study of the plankton and sea-weeds as food of fish has been regularly pursued .
Simultaneously hydrographical investigations have also been conducted to obtain data on pH , sp. gr ., salinity , phosphate content , oxygen , and silica content etc. Sea water from the stations at which plankton hauls are made is brought in standard bottles for estimation .
An insulated water bbttle has been designed in the Laboratory and surface temperatures are regularly recorded .
Three hauls of plankton-horizontal and surface - - horizontal 1 5 metre , and vertical are made every alternate day between I and 6 a.m. at a. station two miles off West Hill , and are examined the same day qualitatively and quantitatively , and the results entered on standardised plankton sheets .
The dry volume of each plankton collection estimated by the filtration method is also recorded .
Phyto and zoo-plankton abundance seems to alternate in the plankton hauls made during the last quarter .
A phyto-plankton peak seems to occur on the Calicut coast corresponding to the S.W .
and N.E .
monsoons , followed by a zoo-plankton peak .
In the Madras coast there is a spring and an autumn peak of phytoplankton .
A study of the agar-yielding species of Indian Rhodophycea ~ ( Gracilaria and Hypnea ) from various localities'shows that apart from G .
lichenoides with an agar-yield of 43 % and G. confervoides with an agar-yield of 25-30 % , there is the third species , G. cdrticat occurring on the W. coast from Kalwar to Cape Comorin and thence up to Madras , with an agar-yield of 5770 .
The estuarine , Hypnea flagelliformis which occurs in dense masses in the Adyar estuary appears to be a poor agar-yielding form , but this is believed to be due to the slow dissolution of the agar in the extracting medium .
`` Redwater '' or `` Slimywater '' phenomenon on thz W .
coast : A thick slimy scum was reported from `` Larvae collected on 6th December continue to live and flourish .
( 78 surface waters.in several fishing centres between Calicut to Gangoli ( h n d a p u r ) - for a period of about a week which seriously affected fishing operations on this coast .
What was a t first a t the surface spread vertically to a depth of 15 fms .
Fishermen found great difficulty in steering their fishing craft and in oper ; ying their fishing gear .
Some mortality of fish ( Arius and Caranx ) was observed , but the insignificance of the mortality considering the widespread nature of the phenomenon presumably indicates that the fish had moved to more off-shore waters .
Investigation showed that the slime consisted of nothing but disintegrating Noctilucae in enormous quantities .
Judging from the quantities of fish landed a t the fish-curing yards in Malabar and S. Kanara in the month of October since 1941 , the fishery in 1948 seems to have dwindled to 50 % of the lowest yield in October 1946 and 25 0/0 of the highest yield in October 1945 .
PHYSIOLOGY The adaptive behaviour of Metapenueus monoceros and related prawns and of fishes like Megalops and Chanos etc. was studied with the help of field data collected at Madras , Cochin and Travancore .
The former is the most adaptable from the physiological point of view as its adaption has been found to be brought a b w t by the active regulation of chloride ions by the prawns themselves .
The correlation of field data with experimental results in the laboratory is expected to provide a basis for the culture of prawns and other highly adaptable commercial species of fish on a large scale .
In this connection refined microtechniques for the estimation of chlorides and urea have been perfected .
The relationship of kidney structure to efficiency of function in Teleostean fishes is also being determined with a view to correlate these data with their behaviour u n d e ~ changed environments .
BIOCHEMISTRY The study of the distribution and seasonal variation of nutrients ( compounds of nitrogen , phosphorus , silicon and iron ) in the surface in shore waters near Madras has been taken up as a preliminary to a more detailed study involving the collection and analysis of samples of water from various depths when the requisite facilities would be available .
Simultaneous determination of salinity and dissolved oxygen content were carried out as a guide to the analysis and to indicate the nature of the samples .
These determinations when carried out over a long period will help in understanding the factors concerned in the changes in the concentration of nutrients .
The methods of analysis closely follow those adopted in corresponding laboratories in Europe and U.S.A. and the values expressed are according to the recommendations of the Int .
Assn .
of Physical Oceanography ( 1939 ) and are therefore readily comparable with similar values for other seas .
The concentration of nutrients in the surface waters are high when compared to the values reported for tropical waters under oceanic conditions .
With the exception of a few marked deviations due mainly to the effect .
of Iocal conditions there is a direct correlation among the values for nutrients .
Nitrates seem to show much wider variations than the phosphates as indicated by the extremely wide divergency in the N / P ratios which are expected ro be constant , but are actually not so owing to the instability of the water system , which are affected greatly by currents , land drainage effects , biological activity , etc.
As the water samples are made during the early part of the day the phytoplankton activity is indicated fairly well by the content of dissolved oxygen , and under stable conditions , as in the month of August , there exists an inverse relationship between nutrients and the dissolved oxygen and therefore the phytoplankton population .
There is thus a remarkable constancy of salinity .
The sudden downward trend in salinity from mid October is correlated with the influx of flood waters into the sea as a result of the monsoons , but there may also be currents of low salinity along the Madras coast during the rainy seasons .
I t is well known that Bacteria play an indispensable role as producers of plant nutrients in the sea and as mineralisers of organic matter , and also as agents of spoilage of fresh and processed fish .
The bacterial flora of inshore open waters and lagoons is at present , being investigated with reference to their seasonal variation , relation to phytoplankton and to fish .
The bacterial population rises sharply in August-September and falls in October-November to the summer level in AprilJune and a fairly close relation between the numerical strength of the bacteria and of the phytoplankton during April-December has been established .
There seems to be a difference in the samples of bacterial population sticking to plankton-nets and those found free in sea water , and some evidence that this population is affected by the abundance of zooplankton which graze on the bacteria has been obtained .
Several physiological groups of bacteria such as ( 1 ) nitrate reducing bacteria ; ( 2 ) urea splitting bacteria ; ( 3 ) cellulose fermenters ; ( 4 ) nitrifying bacteria , have been detected .
Of these the first is the most numerous .
Three distinct strains of marine chromogenic bacteria have been isolated .
Some evidence has been gathered that the phosphorus of decaying phytoplankton is converted to inorganic phosphate only by microbial activity .
Investigations on ' the liberation of phosphate by bacterial action are being taken up in view of the importance of phosphate as plant nutrient in the sea .
Bacteriological analysis of the Adyar river water in Madras was undertaken to determine how far the shell-fish grown in this area are fit for human consumption .
Considerable numbers of coliform organisms ( Escherichia coli ) in the shell-fish growing areas have been detected a t all times .
No relationship between chlorinity and density of coliform organism has been established , but in p H ranges between 7.8 and 8.8 coliform organisms are able to survive and multiply rapidly .
FISHERY SURVEY SECTION After a rapid preliminary survey of the fishing industry in individual zones , .
f o r a period of about six months , covering all general information about the fishing populations , craft and gear , fishlandings and other conditions , the Survey staff is now in a position to conduct more detailed surveys in the more important fishing centres .
Standard forms for collection of information have been prepared and given to the survey assistants whb will now record definite data on unit fishing effort in relation to the types of craft and gear , number of men employed , size of'gear , distance from shore , time spent in effort , qualitative and quantitative estimates of catch and sizes and sexual maturity of fish .
I t is expected that one complete year 's data will provide sufficient material for statistical analysis and scientific interpretation .
CENTRAL INLAND FISHERIES RESEARCH STATION , CALCUTTA Some of the Universities in India as also the fishery departments in the Provinces and States have in the past made a few attempts at solving certain vroblems of inland fisheries : but the limitations of staff , finance and facilities have been in the way of methodical research on inland fisheries on any comprehensive basis .
With the growing importance of fish farming and the desirability of utilising all cul & able waters in the country for food production the need for planned and co-ordinated fishery research on an all India basis has been recognised .
Under existing conditions the Government of India had to undertake research work in Inland Fisheries for a period of 5 years at the first instance in connection with the interim fisheries scheme .
The Central Inland Fisheries Research Station , came into formal existence with the appointment of an Assistant Research Officer in March , 1947 ; while the Chief Research Ofticer took charge in June 1947 , and the majority of the technical staff were recruited towards the end of 1948 .
With the return of all the trainees from abroad , the sanctioned staff is expected to be working full strength from 1949 onwards .
The present organisation of the main section of the Station is shown in Statement No. 1 .
The objective of the station is to increase the production of fish in inland waters by : investigating the nature of their fishery resources , the liydtobiological and other environmental factors influencing them , the optimum conditions for the maximum output and the means of exploiting the different types of fish crop with adequate conservation .
While the varied and complex problems relating to the above mentioned aspects of Inland Fisheries would require prolonged research by a large band of workers specialized in different lines , what is aimed at during the five years of work by the limited staff of this Station is only an elucidation of the most urgent probIems_with an immediate bearing on Aquiculture .
Training of suitable personnel for fishery development is also being attended to .
Starting with Calcutta / Pulta as the centre of the Research Station , the work will in due course extend to suitable substations in areas which are fairly representative of the different types of water and ecology concerned so that the results obtained could be applied with advantage in similar waters in other parts of the country .
Necessary co-ordination with existing research activities of universities and other scientific institutions will also be effected .
The programme of research work is outlined below : - POND CULTURE ( i ) Ascertain and promote the optimum condition of water contents ; pond bottom , manuring etc ., for maximum production .
( ii ) Study the food , feeding and breeding habits , rates of growth , parasites , other enemies and diseases of important freshwater food fishes such as Labeo rohita , Labeo calbasu , Catla catla , Cirrhina mrigala , Osphronemus gourami , Mugil corsula , murrels etc. ( iii ) Raise fish seed for culture by elucidating the requirements of '' bundhs `` and other types of breeding tanks .
( iv ) Find out cheap and effective methods of weed control , ( v ) Systematise the technique of fish culture and ( vi ) Establish judicious fishing methods .
ESTUARINE RESEAliCH ( i ) Conservancy and development measures , by studying the breeding habits and life histories and bionomics of food fishes such as Hilsa ilisha , Mullets , Lates calcarifer , Prawns etc. ( ii ) Prediction and regulation of the yields from the fisheries by ascertaining causes of annual fluctuations .
( iii ) Exploiting underfished areas and ( iv ) Improving fishing methods Increase the natural harvest from estuaries and backwaters Develop brackishwater fish farming by ascertai + ng and developing to the optimum hydrobiological factors for brackishwater farming and In view of the increasing demand for fish seed in Provinces and States , exploit salt-water fish seed resources for inland pisciculture by developing seed collection grounds and improving : he technique of collection , acclimatisation and transport of saltwater fish seed .
RIVERINE & LACUSTRINE WORK ( a ) Improve the direct catch from rivers and lakes by ( i ) .
Locating undertapped fishing groynds through systematic river surveys ( ii ) Devising suitable methods of fishing to tackle such grounds .
( b ) Conserve the fluviatile fisheries of the river systems as a whole by .
determining the requirements of migrat0r.y fishes in connection with dams .
and anicuts .
Find out ways and means of enriching the river crop by regional stocking and stream manuring and Locate breeding grounds and natural nurseries of riverine and lacustrine fishes for increasing the supply of fish seed for cultural purposes , UNITS OF WORK Apart from the Divisions of i ) Pond Culture , ii ) Estuarine Research and iii ) Riverine and Lacustrine work , by the nature of allocation of problems , the following special units would be functioning at the Station : ( i ) BIOMETRIC UNIT : Under an Assistant Research Officer ( Inland Biology-Biometrics ) , who with the help of other officers working on hydrobiology , will try to elucidate the composition and densities of populations of fish and other biota and the fluctuation thereof on a statistical basis under varying conditions in the waters under investigation , the objective being to promote the optimum population conditions for fish productivity .
( ii ) FISH PATHOLOGY UNIT : Under an Assistant Research Ogcer ( Pathology ) , to study and control parasites , diseases and mortality of fishes in various stages .
( iii ) FISHERY ENGINEERING UNIT : Under an Assistant Research Officer ( Fishery Engineer ) to study the hydrographical conditions of dams and anicuts with reference to fish migration and to devise the best type of fish passes to suit Indian conditions , to standardise the construction and maintenance of fish farms , etc. ( iv ) FISHERY BOTANY UNIT : Under an Assistant Research Oflicer ( Botany ) to study the various aquatic flora harmful as well as beneficial to fisheries , the optimum conditions for the economic regulation of aquatic vegetation , etc. ( v ) FISHERY CHEMISTRY UNIT : Under an Assistant Research Officer ( Chemistry ) to elucidate the physico-chemical factors influencing fish productivity , investigate the possibilities of aquatic manuring the effects of algacides and insecticides on hydrobiota , the problem of water pollution , etc. Further there are the Carcinology Unit , the Hilsa Unit , the Mullet Unit , the Carp Unit , the Fisheries Training Unit etc ., also at the Station .
EQUIPMENT The Station is equipped with essential apparatus and equipment required immediately for commencing laboratory and field investigations , such as microscopes , lenses , microtome , bath , balance , glassware , chemicals , lank ton and fishing nets , a small boat , field tents etc. Additional items including power boats , gear , transport truck etc ., have been indented for and other necessary equipment would be arranged to be obtained ir !
due course , 4 THE ORGANISATION AND UTILISATION OF PLANKTON INVESTIGATIONS by H. Thompson Plankton investigations are an indispensable concomitant of exploratory work and of hydrological and fishery biological studies .
However , they require careful planning in order to avoid being unproductive and to ensure prompt working up , interpretation and utilisation .
The accumulation of unexamined collections is to be avoided .
UTILISATION The following are some of the results to be looked for from plankton investigations : - I. On the qwalitative side : ( a ) a knowledge is secured of the types of organisms occurring during exploratory work in little known waters , which can then be classified as to type - - e.g. antarctic , subantartic , cold temperate , warm temperate , subtropical , tropical ; oi Pacific ( east , oceanic or west ) , Indo-Pacific , Australasian etc.
Such a knowledge aids the hydrologist and affords a rough idea of the class of fishery to be anticipated ; ( b ) aids are provided for the detection ( at a sufficiently early stage to allow of prediction in the fisheries ) of significant annual and seasonal fluctuations in oceanographic conditions .
Thus unusual incursions of salps to the North Sea have been correlated with relative absence of herring , and , in Newfoundlafid waters , the easib observed variation in the degree of the springtime incursion of a large Arctic species , Oikopleura vanhojeeni , indicates variations in the fishery for codfish , which in that region are most plentiful in cold water ; ( c ) in the case of a prolic fishery - + + that for herring in the North Sea-plankton indicating apparatus may be devised as a practical guide to fishermen ; ( d ) material ( eggs , larvae and food organisms ) are obtained and afford information on spawning grounds , distribution and life-histories .
2 .
On the quantitative .
side , hydrological studies of water-productivity can be assisted .
Volumes or serial and su & ciently numerous hauls of plankton taken by standard nets ( especially vertical hauls with closing nets ) yield results which have a certain quantitative va1ue-a value which will be enhanced where chemical analyses , or their equivalent , follow .
Counting of predominant organisms also has some limited value .

THE ORGANISATION AND UTILISATION OF PLANKTON INVESTIGATIONS I. On the qwalitative side : ( a ) a knowledge is secured of the types of organisms occurring during exploratory work in little known waters , which can then be classified as to type - - e.g. antarctic , subantartic , cold temperate , warm temperate , subtropical , tropical ; oi Pacific ( east , oceanic or west ) , Indo-Pacific , Australasian etc.
Such a knowledge aids the hydrologist and affords a rough idea of the class of fishery to be anticipated ; by H. Thompson Plankton investigations are an indispensable concomitant of exploratory work and of hydrological and fishery biological studies .
However , they require careful planning in order to avoid being unproductive and to ensure prompt working up , interpretation and utilisation .
The accumulation of unexamined collections is to be avoided .
UTILISATION The following are some of the results to be looked for from plankton investigations : - I. On the qwalitative side : ( a ) a knowledge is secured of the types of organisms occurring during exploratory work in little known waters , which can then be classified as to type - - e.g. antarctic , subantartic , cold temperate , warm temperate , subtropical , tropical ; oi Pacific ( east , oceanic or west ) , Indo-Pacific , Australasian etc.
Such a knowledge aids the hydrologist and affords a rough idea of the class of fishery to be anticipated ; ( b ) aids are provided for the detection ( at a sufficiently early stage to allow of prediction in the fisheries ) of significant annual and seasonal fluctuations in oceanographic conditions .
Thus unusual incursions of salps to the North Sea have been correlated with relative absence of herring , and , in Newfoundlafid waters , the easib observed variation in the degree of the springtime incursion of a large Arctic species , Oikopleura vanhojeeni , indicates variations in the fishery for codfish , which in that region are most plentiful in cold water ; ( c ) in the case of a prolic fishery - + + that for herring in the North Sea-plankton indicating apparatus may be devised as a practical guide to fishermen ; ( d ) material ( eggs , larvae and food organisms ) are obtained and afford information on spawning grounds , distribution and life-histories .

On the quantitative .
side , hydrological studies of water-productivity can be assisted .
Volumes or serial and su & ciently numerous hauls of plankton taken by standard nets ( especially vertical hauls with closing nets ) yield results which have a certain quantitative va1ue-a value which will be enhanced where chemical analyses , or their equivalent , follow .
Counting of predominant organisms also has some limited value .

I t leads to Borneo and the Suada Straits , which are the cradle regions for tropical fish and reaches the Antarctic Ocean , which is the home of whaling .
The coast line is unusually developed .
On the main land alone it is 8,693 km .
long .
W h n the 3,3 05 coastal islands are added , the coast line has a length of 17,269 km .
Fishing grounds can be found almost everywhere in the coastal sea of Korea and , except for those of the coast of Wungi , none of the ports is frozen in winter , and practically all of the ports are open for fishing vessels throughout the year .
If proper measures are taken and processing facilities are provided , the fishery .
can be naturally developed in this region so lavishly provided for fishing .
Though there were such rich grounds for fishiig , the industry could not be developed in the feudalistic period when the people , from their ignorance and prejudice , ignored the good grounds and fishermen clung to the in-shore grounds without even thinking of the oceans .
However , from the beginning of the 20th Century , modern scientific technique and capital were imported , and the Korean fishery began to see rapid development .
Especially in 1922 when the fishing ground for pilchard in the eastern sea was found , and during the ensuing 20 years , that single kind of fish made new record , both in its production and processing , unparalleled in the history of the world .
Truly in the 193OYs , the Korean fishery met its golden age .
In 1939 , total production reached 2,621,199 tons , with a value of 327,322,568 Won ( about U.S. $ 80 million ) : fishing 151,098,000 Won ; cultured 8,307,876 Won ; processed 167,916 Won .
In that year , the fishery represented 18 % of the whole Korean industry , and thus it was next only to agriculture , and Korea became the second fishiig nation in the world .
The main marine organisms of Karea include about 120 kinds ( fish 71 kinds , shell fish 20 kinds , marine plants 11 kinds , and other 10 kinds ) ; In 19 37 , the marine products whose value exceeded one In 1939 , the amount of exports reached 117 million Won each ( about 250 thousand dollars ) million Won ( about U.S. $ 28 million at that time ) ; were about 2 1 in number , as the following : 28 % of the products were exported to Japan .

Moreover , Japan , with the motto `` Why shall we not use the treasures which have been developed for 36 years ?
'' abolished the laws for the protection of fish reproduction and exhausted the marine resources for her war purposes .
Thus the products gradually decreased , and from 2,046,243 tons in 1939 they fell to 1,318,041 tons in 1941 , 845,782 tons in 1942 and finally in 1944 , fishing of pilchard was eliminated .
As the war went on , materials were in short supply , the sea was dangerous and the marine resources were decreased because of the unrestricted catching .
The total products were only 690,000 tons in 1944 .
11 .
PRESENT CONDITION 1 .
Amount of products : Since the liberation , Korea has been divided into two parts .
The actual condition in North Korea is not known , and no account of the fishery of the whole of Korea can be given .
If we estimate from the evidence in hand , judging from the 268,146 tons of fishery products in South Korea in 1948 , the fishery products throughout Korea may be estimated at about 450,000 tons .
Thus , it has not reached the previous average record ( 600,000 tons for the whole of Korea , 300,000 tons for South Korea ) of the products .
The main cause is the unrestrained fishing , that is no estimate was made each year , after careful investigation and estimation of whole marine resources and the amount of reproduction of the amount of fishing which would not hinder reproduction .
If this situation is left as i t is , the amount of coastal fishing will gradually decrease .
Among others , the resources of cod fish are being dried up .
The products of cod in South Korea were 13,046 tons in 1947 , but they were decreased suddenly to 5,124 tons in 1948 .

They include such modern fishing techniques as drag net fishing and purse seine fishing but also such primitive fishing as diving and single line fishing .
The licences issued number 124,000 .
The fishing can divided into that on fixed ground and removing fishing .

Ice Making Freezing & Cold Storage Thirty-one ice plants were located in South Korea prior to 1945 .
Many of them were dismantled by the Japanese during and immediately after surrender .
However , as machinery , equipment and supplies become available each plant is being placed in operation .
Total capacity of the thirty-one plants is 824.5 tons .
About fiffy per cent of these are now in operation and approximately two-thirds the output is used for icing fish vessels .
The ice in most loadings is sheared into `` snow ice '' thus enabling better icing of the fish and also lofiger freezing of the product .
Iced fresh fish is transported to every section of Sduth Korea in a well preserved state .
Freezing and cold storage total capacity is 300,000 metric tons .
6 .
Processing ( a ) Salting ( See Table , Page 85 ) Future production of dried fish is estimated at over 100,000 metric tons annually .
Annual salt requirement is 100,000 tons .
Operations ire carried .
on with crude materials .
Both dry salting and boiling are employed .
The bulk of the products is made i n ' the localities in which the fish are landed .
Salt is obtained from salterns and is imported from China and the United States .
( b ) Drying ( See Table , Page 85 ) In 1948 the total amount of dried fish was 20,966 metric tons .
The future program calls for greatly increased production of dried fish , especially for export .
Extensive installations for drying fish are not at present available .
The two methods used are boiling and drying and sundrying after evisceration .
More sanitary methods are now being intro - - .
duced .
( c ) Canning ( See Table , Page 85 ) There were thirty one canneries in.South Korea prior to the war .
The Japanese destroyed or removed much of the machinery and equipment , leaving the plants in an inoperable condition .
Thirteen have now been rehabilitated to a certain degree by cannibalization of machinery , equipment and supplies .
A total of 200 metric tons of canned goods was produced in 1948 .
Since nearly all of the fish catch is now consumed by the population in the form of fresh , salted or - dried fish , and because of the acute shortage of tinplate , the plants are now being kept in operating order for future export of canned products .
However , the production of crab is very rich and in 1949 , a great number of empty tin cans has been imported through ECA from U.S.A. Thus , about 80 tons of canned crab can be exported .
( d ) Fishmeal and byprod & oil prewar - All Korea ' The end-products were fertilizers , soap ' and textile preservatives .
Potential production is estimated at 20,000 m / t .
The principal sources of fish oil was the sardine ( Sardinops ) .
Fish meal was a byproduct , The entire product was handled as nonedible , and was not connected with canneries .
Sardines have since disappeared ; but they may return .
Whaling constitutes a source of fish meal and oil .
Whaleoil output was 152 m / t i n 1948 .
The future production of meal , fertilizer , oils etc. is being given serious thought , and research is now being conducted with non edible fish and marine life to replace the sardine .
Halibut and cod livers are preserved for vitamin oil of which a large output is expected in the next few years .
This is an industry new to Korea .
7 .
System of marketing Fishermen deliver catch to the Guilds and Unions which act as co-operative agencies in selling the produce to the retailers .
Many of the middlemen have been eliminated thus assuring fair prices to the fishermen for their products , as well as reasonable prices per fish to the consumer .
No retailer is allowed to control the market or price of any particular species , as was formerly possible .
Only a certain number is placed in each box for sale and each retailer is limited in the number of boxes he may purchase daily .
Prior to surrender each species was placed in one large pile and sold to a single individual , who , by purchase of all of the one species available , could control the retail sales price .
8. Fish and Shell fish Culture There were two provinces in South Korea which , prewar , had fish hatcheries : Kyansang Namdo and Kyongsang Pukto .
Carp were ~ roduced in the former province .
During the war production was reduced to a minimum .
Kyongsang Pukto hatchery produces cod and herring ; .
in 1939 , 19,668,000,000 in 1940 , 12,240,000,000 .
Eggs were hatched and released shortly after hatching .
It did not operate during 1943-45 .
An extensive artificial eggtaking program is carried on during the cod season .
Numerous vessels are emp !
oyed .
The adult cod are taken from the sea , the eggs stripped , fertilization is effected and the fertilized eggs released into the sea .
20,000,000,000 eggs were , fertilized and released into the sea during the 1941146 season ; 21,000,000,000 during 19461 47 ; 30,000,000,000 during 1947148 .
Kyongsang Namdo hatchery was reopened in 1946 and 165 , OO young fry eggs produced .
In 1947 300,000 young fry were produced ; in 1948 ; 400,000 .
Repairs are now , being made and the planned program calls for vastly increased production in 1949 .
The new hatchery in Kyonggi Do was operated for the first time in 1944 .
Production was 14,800 young fish and 30,000 eggs .
There was no production in 1945-47 , but in 1948 , 200,000 young fry were produced .
Repairs are now being completed to achieve maximum production .
Kyongsang Namdo hatchery and rearing grounds cover 42 acres ; Kyonggi Do has 20 acres with 23 rearing ponds .
The program for the above hatcheries calls - for a production of 100,000,000 fry .
Eight other hatcheries and rearing ponds are now contemplated , to be located a t strategically central points for local distribution to increase inlandwater food production .
The fry will cost the farmer five chun each and will be placed in the local streams , pools , ponds and rice paddies .
Future operations calla for greatly increased production in all of the above fields and require the full utilization of all hatching , rearing and collection facilities to make available an effective supply of carp , which is the best k i d of fresh water fish for this purpose in Korea .

ADMINISTRATION I. Statistics Production , marketing and biological information is collected by provincial sections of the Bureau of Fisheries which has a statistical section to facilitate the collection of data .
This information is transmitted to the National Office where it is edited and distributed .
Biological and scientific information is cbllicted by the research and experimental stations which are under the National Bureau of Fisheries .
Statistics are collected by various agencies-Unions , Guilds , Co-operatives , Associations .
Publishing is done by the Department of Commerce from materials supplied by the provinces .
The Department of Public Information and Education supplies radio material and newspaper information .
Aeroplanes are also used to distribute information .
2 .
Technological Research a d Education A large volume of these records is available at the main Research and Experiment Station but all are in Japanese and translation is slow due to the lack of personnel to do this work .
3 .
Conservation Research The setting up of an effective and efficient conservation program is now in progress .
This aims at the regulation of coastal waters , of the size of net mesh , the size of fish , season of take , amount of catch , use of explosives , range of various types and sizes of vessels , inshore fishing limits , protection of spawning beds , and so forth .
4 .
Regulating Policy Inshore fishing grounds are leased .
The National Bureau regulates the leasing of fishing grounds which are closed to p-ersons not having possession of the rights to any particular grounds .
These grounds are in the greater part leased to fishermen residing in villages adjacent to the fishing grounds .
At present there is also an international regulation controlled by the Far East Command Japanese encroachment of Korean fishing areas .
This is enforced by the Coast Guard and Customs Office .
Changes under consideration are programs to eliminate waste by enforcing more sanitary methods of handling and marhting , and a system of patrol conducted by the Bureau of Fisheries .
The fishermen form Fisheries Guilds in each district and the Fisheries Guilds form Fishery Associations in each Province .
Large-scale operatives and fishermen engaged in special types of operations , from their own Marine Association according to their own kind .
Under the leadership of the Korean Fisheries Corporation , they exchange fishing equipment and capital .
In South Korea , there are : Fisheries ' Guilds .

fnspect ; on Stations There are seventeen Inspection Stations .
The main station is located in Seoul and there are two in each province .
Eighty persons are required to staff and operate the stations .
Their functions are to inspect all marine products , including fish both for home consumption and for export .
These stations also inspect fish oils and all seaweeds .
8. Fishing Materials Of essential fishing materials , Korea needs heavy oil , light oil , manila rope , cotton net , cotton thread , timber , lead , rubber , tinplate , ammonia , bamboo , salt and many other items .
Since the liberation , the fishermen have been maintaining their fishing with the materials left over or materials in hand , but there has been very little supply of new materials within the country .
They have to be imported from outside .
( See Five Year Plan below ) .
In contrast with the golden ages in the past , the present fisheries are making poor use of their rich possibilities .
However , when compared with other industries in Korea , the importance of the fisheries cannot be overestimated .
It is a most urgent and important national task to plan for the development of fisheries , for this will contribute to a solution of the problems of health and food anil of maintaining the balance of international trade .
To establish the counter ~ lan for the future .
it is necessarv to investigate and'understand the present status of technicians , materials and marine resources .
The fishing population of South Korea is 340,000 , and forms only 1.7 % of the whole population .
In contrast to Japan , the fishing population was distinctly small .
In view of the importance of fisheries , the population could be increased by 50 % of the present population .
One thing to be noticed concerning the fishing population is that most of the fishing business men with the education of high school or higher , have entered the industry only since the liberation .
n e i r experience , technique and capital will have to be supplemented in the future .
From this point of view also , the guidance and protection by the Government are greatly needed .
Among the fishing materials , more important materials such as timbers for shipbuilding , motor engines , thread for nets , oil for fishing have to be imported from outside to increase .
the output .
While marine resources must be protected by a conservation policy , deep-sea fishing and inland water fishing will , on the other hand , have to be positively promoted .

6 RASTRELLIGER KANAGURTA ( Ruppell ) Its Fishery and Biology Summary of our Knowledge-Study Programmes by J. Durand D. Sc .
Oceanographic Institute of Indo-China In spite of its small size ( it hardly exceeds twenty centimetres ) this fish forms the basis of a fishery and an important industry through all the Indo-Pacific region , and for this reason it is worthy of our interest in its biology and movements , because it is a migratory fish .
This short note does not presume to present all known information on this small fish .
I t is certainly incomplete .
Its only aim is to call forth complementary information from different countries of the Indo-Pacific region , for their utilisation in a more developed study of the biology of this fish and a more methodical organisation of its fishery .
POSITION IN NOMENCLATURE It belongs to the family Scombridae and to the genus Rastrelliger , characterised by the absence of vomerine and palatine teeth and by the length of the gill-rakers which protrude into the buccal cavity .
The synonymy of this species is rather obscure , because local races or individuals of different ages have been described under different names by various authors .
In my opinion , although I have not been able to examine the types , it is reasonable to suppose that the following species are synonymous : Scomber kanagurta Russell 1803 s. loo Lesson 1829 S. microlepidotus Ruppell 18 3 5 S. chryzosonus Ruppell 18 3 8 Like fish of economic interest , it possesses a large number of vernacular names .
Following is a list , still incomplete : Malaya Kernbung-Pala ta Indonesia Kembung-lelaki Philippines Alumahan-hmahan Siam Pla-thu Cambodia Trey Kamong Cochinchina Ca bac ma Annam Chiia Japan Gurukun-Murchji In this note I shall generally use the Siamese name `` Pla-thu '' , which is most often used in Indo-China .
GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION The area of distribution of this species is very great since it extends throughout the tropical zone of the Indo-Pacific region , giving the widest acceptance to this term , such as was used by Fowler for example in `` Fishes of Qceania '' , that is to say from the Red Sea and East Coast of Africa to the West Coast of America .
However , i t seems that nowhere is i t the basis of a simple and intense a fishery as on the coasts of Malaya , Siam and Cambodia .
BIOLOGY Coasts of Cambodia and Siam The Pla-thu appears on the coast of Cambodia towards the end of October in the neighbourhood of the Bay of Kampong-Som ; a month later near Cone Island and Kaskapik .
I t remains there until February , a period when the females are ripe and ready to spawn .
Neither is its fishery continuous .
I t disappears after a storm , wind or other causes still little known , to reappear when conditions are again favourable , Its stomach is generally filled with a geenish pulp , probably formed of microscopic algae .
Pla-thu is also caught on the East coast of Siam , but generally rather later than in Cambodia .
On the West coast of Siam and on the Malayan coast , Pla-thu is also present , but according to Dr. H. M. Smith , for a long time Fisheries Adviser to the Siamese Government , it is a different fish there .
On the other hand , from May to July , in the South-West monsoon , large quantities of young Plathou , whose length reaches a maximum of 7 centimetres , are seen on the Siamese coast in the vicinity of Koh-Chang and the Bay of Tung-Yai .
The Indies According to Day ( Fishes of India ) the eggs are well deve !
oped in March , that is to say at the same time as in the Gulf of Siam and it is caught in abundance on the Malabar coast during the cold season .
Japan According to Kishinouye , it is common in the neighbourhood of the Ryukyu islands , where small individuals are caught in summer and large ones in winter .
In calm periods , schools of these fish can be observed frisking near the surface in shallow water , feeding actively on small planktonic organisms .
FISHING METHODS On the coasts of Cambodia and Siam , large quantities of PIa-thu are fished during the winter months ( November to February ) in fixed traps , established on the muddy bottom in depths varying from four to fifteen metres .
These traps comprise a kidney-shaped enclosure measuring 50 m. at its greatest diameter , formed of fixed fences of stakes driven into the mud .
This enclosure , which is the capturing chamber , is preceded by another smaller heart-shaped enclosure , towards which converge rows of stakes reaching several hundred metres in length , and whose free end is directed towards the land .
Schools of Pla-thu and other fish meeting these rows of .
stakes , follow them out towards the sea and thus enter the ' capture chamber .
in which they turn round in circles without succeeding in finding the entrance .
Then they only have to be caught .
A barge with a straight net enters the chamber ; one end of the net is fixed to a stake at the side of the entrance , the other end to the front of the barge which makes a complete circuit of the capturing chamber , taking care to pass first across the entrance .
During this circuit , the upper rope of the net is maintained on the surface with the aid of floats , whilst the lower rope is kept on the bottom of the water .
The fish are thus driven into a more and more reduced space .
A running rope is then worked which transforms the straight net into a pocket and the fish are taken on board with the help of scoops .
In this way , one trap collects an average of 50 to 80 tons of fish per season .
METHOD OF PREPARATION-ECONOMIC INTEREST In Cambodia , the remoteness of fishing grounds and the slowness of transport means that the fish cannot be despatched fresh .
A few attempts have been made with ice , but without any great success .
The most widespread method of preparation consists of gutting the fish through the gills , leaving it for a few days in a brine of 15 kg .
of salt per picul of fish , then letting it dry , preferably in the shade .
Thus re pa red , the fish is not much appreciated by Indo-Chinese people , but on the other hand , i t is popular for export .
Before the war ., the Siamese steamer of the Bangkok-Hatien Line came each week into the fishinga centres ( Kaskapik , Cheko , Ream ) and took up the produce in each place .
The fish was then re-despatched to Singapore , and from there largely to Java .
.
.
' D U ~ & the war , the Siamese steamer , having ceased its service , the Pla-thu was sent directly to Java .
Another method of treatment different from the above , which is much appreciated in Indo-China , consists of arranging the fish in small open-work bamboo baskets and boiling them for a few minutes in large basins of sea-water , supercharged with 5 kg .
of salt per 20 litres of water , Thus prepared , the fish will keep for a fortnight , on condition that it is boiled for a few minutes every two days .
It can thus reach the remotest villages in the interior and this method of preparation is tending to become more and more popuiar .
Finally , a factory was installed a few year ago at Cheko , an important fishing centre and makes pre - serves of Pla-thu in oil or tomato , similar in flavour to American pilchards .
For dried Pla-thu alone , the export for an average ycar is estimated at about 3,000 tons .
The demand being always superior to the supply , the production could be greatly increased without risk of sales at a loss .
The simplest solution would obviously be to increase the number of fixed fishing traps , but suitable places being rather limited , the traps would obstruct one another and the yield per trap would diminish .
The consruction of such traps also requires expensive materials and a lot of operatives in a region which is poor in these , and indeed numerous fishermen are retreating bef ~ re the high renting price , and the number of traps has decreased by 50 % between 1940 and 1948 .
Also this method of ancestral fish ; ry , although in general giving appreciable results , possesses serious inconveniences .
In some years , for causes still unknown , schools of Pla-thu do not approach suficiently near to the coast to be taken in these fish traps and the catch is nil ; now a more complete knowledge of the biology of this fish will doubtless permit fishing further afield with suitable equipment .
THE PROBLEMS OF FISH STORAGE AND REFRIGERATION IN SOUTH EAST ASIA by W. B. Braxton , M. Sc .
The objective o f ' this paper is to review the present condition of the South East Asia fishing industry from a technical and economic view-point and to consider the application of the possible steps of refrigeration development in improving the quantity and quality of fish available to the local population .
We will draw more heavily on the information available for Malaya for this purpose since this is somewhat typical of the territory .
Although the problems of refrigeration , as applied afloat , on land and in transportation to the major consumption centres , must be covered individually in detail , we shall at this stage restrict opr study to the proper refriger - ation developments of the first two steps or the process , namely , handling the catch at sea and at the collection centre .
EXISTTNC CONDITIONS : Climatic .
The whole territory of South East Asia has the common problem , typified by Malaya , of year-round high temperature and humidity with certain coastal exposures faced with monsoons which regularly limit fishing activities .
STUDY PROGRAMMES The Oceanographic Institute of Indo-Chiia intends to initiate a study on this question whose programme is briefly as follows : ( 1 ) Determination of the conditions required by these fish in their migration by studying plankton , by analysing the stomach content of the fish , and by observing the temperature and the salinity of surface and deep water .
( 2 ) Tagging of f i sh - a certain number of fish would be marked on the coast of Cambodia at the end of the fishing season ( February for instance ) .
In this the TndoPacific Fisheries Council could be of great practical use , because the recovery of these tagged fish would necessitate some international co-operation .
The fish tagged in Cambodia could indeed be caught on the coast of Siam or Malaya , or even in India ; it would therefore be necessary to organise sufficient publicity in these different countries for the fishermen reporting a tagged fish , or at least the tag with some information ( place and date of capture , length of fish ) to be assured of receiving a fairly substantial bonus .
( 3 ) Research of the schools of fish by generic equipment Asdic etc. and study of the most suitable fishing equipment for their capture .

( 3 ) Research of the schools of fish by generic equipment Asdic etc. and study of the most suitable fishing equipment for their capture .
In considering refrigeration requirements it must be kept in mind that fish have a temperature approximately 40 ' warmer in the waters surrounding the South East Asia countries than that in temperate climates .
Consequently if no refrigeration is provided , spoilage is greatly accelerated and refrigeration equipment must necessarily be of larger capacity to perform the work required than facilities equipped to operate in temperate water .
Technical .
In most of this area the fishing industry consists of small owners operating relatively small boats , having short range of action and rarely powered .
The great majority of Malayan fishing boats rely for their propulsion on sail augmented or replaced , when necessary , by oars or paddles .
Power driven craft are used in the larger ports for fishing or bringing the catch back from kelon-gs or they may be used in taking local sailing boats to and from the fishing gt ounds .
Sailing boats range in size from a length of about 12 feet to 45 fcet , all having considerable variation in their finish .
All of these boats are operated from , and in many cases , in shallow water , frequently requiring beaching at the end of each fishing trip ; they are consequently of shallow draft without keels of any appreciable depth .
None of the boats are decked , though floor boards are fitted to separate off the bilge and provide a level dry base .
The spaces between the ribs and the flooring are generally used for stowing the catch .
Boats differ regionally to allow for physiography and the nature of the fishing grounds .
In the North East , the coast consists of long sandy beaches , broken a t intervals by estuaries where mangroves occur ; rough weather is prevalent even in the calm season ; in many instances the fishing grounds lie ten or more miles from land .
As a general rule the fishermen try to get to their fishing grounds with the pre-dawn wind from the land and return with the afternoon wind from the sea .
In the South of the Peninsula and on the West coast the sampan is frequently used since the coasts are less expoyd than on the North East and a great proportion of the fishing is done close in-shore , principally with hand lines , cast nets or small nets .
The ports from which most of these craft operate are relatively primitive and rarely provide for a central power system which could be used for driving necessary refrigeration equipment on land .
The existing refrigeration shore facilities , with the exception of a few of the larger cities , are nonexistent and drying and salting of fish is a necessity , since this provides the only method of preserving the food value of the catch .
Very little of the catch , beyond that portion used for local consumption in the fishing village , is marketed in a fresh condition .
The character of present fishing operations is one of primary transaction taking place in the smaller fishing villages and the product , which is now dried and salted , is handled by merchants for distribution to the larger cities of the territory .
Economic .
A Study of the average of four officially recorded prices of fish on the Singapore masket for 1948 indicates consumer prices p & katty of $ 1.56 for fresh fish compared with $ 1.18 for the same dried salted fish ; if an average of 2 % katties of fresh fish are required to produce 1 katty of dry fish then the equivalent price of salted fish in a fresh form is 47 cents , as compared to $ 1.56 ; fishermen thus dispose of their catch at very reduced prices .
This low price reduces the fishermen 's incentive to increase their catch since the price level of fish to be disposed of in a salted or dried condition provides them with only marginal earnings .
The lack of proper central refrigerated handling facilities may thus be an essential factor limiting the size of the catch .
Since neither the supply nor the demand appear as yet near full development , the controlling factor of the size of the catch would appear to be limited mostly by the lack of proper refrigerated collection , handling , storage , transportation and distribution facilities .
Studies of the price of fish during monsoon seasons , at which time the catch may be almost entirely stopped , must be used in the statistical analysis for the planning of the application of refrigeration to the fishing units and afterwards to the larger processing plants which may be required to handle the catch properly at all steps of the distribution process .
Further consideration of the probable effect on the entire social structure of the fishing industry must be contemplated , since in the future , with suitable refrigeration equipment available for the handling of the catch it would appear that the proportion of dried and salted fish would be consider ?
ably smaller than fresh fish .
We may conclude , as a basis for establishing refrigeration facilities that an average fishing centre would require immediately central collection facilities suitable to handle not less than 50 % of the catch ; this figure might increase to over 7570 of the catch within a relatively short period .
Demand for specially processed fish would probably remain for several generations as the taste for these delicacies has been cultivated over centuries .
The general effect on prices of fish with full use of suitable refrigeration should be to raise that of dried and salted fish as i t will not be necessary for the fishermen to dump surplus catch into this form of processing , while that of fresh or frozen fish will decline , since the cost of storage per unit of weight is very reasonable .
As the average price earned by the fishermen for their catch increases , a larger quantity of fish would become available to the consumer .
REFRIGERATION APPLICATIONS Afloat .
The vast majority of these shhrt range fishing boats can readily be equipped with iced bunkers of suitable capacity for the ship size involved .
From the above description of the boats involved it will become obvious that iced bunkers are the only form of refrigeration applications which can be contemplated .
Such iced bunkers would permit longer trips than usual practise with the catch arriving at the collection centre in the best of condition .
In the case of the larger sailing boats used for net operations in deep sea , the .
probable size of bunker would have a carrying capacity of the magnitude of 1 5 piculs .
For the smaller.boats used with handlines the size of the bunker would probably not exceed 6 piculs and for sampans would probably not exceed a capacity of 2 piculs .
As previously noted , due to the simplicity of the average fishing boat the only possible application to be applied to the non powered ships would be ice bunkers supplied with crushed ice in sizes not less than 3 / 16 `` so as to prevent excessive caking in the bunker .
For the size of bunkers involved and 24 hour trips , the quantity of ice , by weight , wiIl be equal to that of the fish .
A bunker to provide for the necessary fish and ice would have a volume of approximately 6-7 cubic feet per picul of iish and could be built for an all in cost in the magnitude of $ 30 in the case of the 6 picul size , For powered mother ships the application of a small ship board refrigeration system is recommended as the quantity of ice needed to hold the fish in the dreshest condition could be cut down to ratios of 1-3 or even 1 4 .
Ships equipped with mechanical refrigeration can easily make trips of 10 or moredays operation with chilled storage at 30 '' F. Mother ships for long range fishing including complete freezing and processing plants will not come to be feasible or required until such time as collection centres , refrigerated land transport and distribution have advanced sufficiently .
Icing Facilities The quantity of ice which will be required at any one fishing port will bear a definite ration to the quantities of fish arrival at such points .
We can assume that not less than 50 % of the fish ' handled would be the first step in designing the capacity of such a centre .
The size of the plant can also vary due to seasonal variations in the catch .
Each ice plant must be located near the water 's edge for easy delivery to boats through ice chutes and be provided with a storage room for ice so that the fishing fleet may obtain its requisite ice quantities whenever it is in port .
If seasonal variations in the catch occur it will prove advisable to have ice storage rooms of considerable capacity since ice can be manufactured thtoughout the whole year but may only be drawn for a period of 7 or 8 months .
An ice plant in such fishing centres should contemplate a small quantity being used for local purchases not directly connected with the fishing industry .
The land icing f ~ cilities should also include a receiving room in which the catch may be sorted and packed in iced crates for future shipment to larger centres or possible preparation for quick freezing and storage if this is economically indicated in the study of the statistics .
It is usually found desirable that the ice be frozen in blocks as this will provide for local sale of the product : while a specialised plant could only furnish ice for fish or other food industry .
The storage of ice in bIock form is also more readily handled than in crushed form ; The crushing of ice should be performed a t the time of loading on board ship .
Storage The question of whether to store fish in a chilled or frozen condition must be determined from the seasonal character of the catch .
Under chilled condition at 30 `` F the normally recomniended storage period should.not exceed two weeks , however , i t is known that in practice this time has been lengthened to four weeks without appreciable deterioration .
If periods of months elapse with reduced supplies landed at the local collection point then frozen storage will be required including quick freezing so as to obtain a marketable product which would retain its premium value .
Under such treatment , storage periods of six months can be easily contemplated .
Room temperatures , in order to keep any frozen product in the best of condition , must not exceed 0 '' F with very small fluctuation in temperatures .
Storage space requirements will vary from 80 to 100 cubic feet of gross space per ton of fish depending on local practises and storage periods .
Freezing Quick freezing and frozen storage is secondary and only the ultimate step which must be thought of when distribution facilities to inlahd cities have been fully developed ; however planning for this eventuality must be considered from the inception of our study .
Freezing of fish should only be accomplished by `` Quick freezing '' which in the case of air blast which provides for the simplest arrangements , requires temperatures in the magnitude of -40 `` F. Storage can be in bulk for with glazing of the product after freezing and reglazing at intervals indicated by service and duration of storage .
Freezing in the round will probably be the first method , but as distribution increases the filleting and freezing together with individual packaging in boxes provided with vapour barriers may become indicated .
The products otherwise lost in the filleting operation , which may amount to well over half the catch should be used for fish meal , production of fish oils or fertiliser , this step in the industrial development of the fishing industry appears relatively remote except in the largest centres .
The costs of equipping such plants are not being covered in this paper as special equipment involved will va5y considerably from installation to installation .
TECHNICAL ASPECTS .
The construction of cold storage rooms should be approached with the most careful technique to provide for minimum heat gains and most permanent construction .
Chiller space would normally be provided with 4 '' of cork walls and 6 `` roof ; the insulation for freezer space would be 2 '' thicker on walls and ceiling .
The preferred construction technique in the sizes contemplated is single storey , with full curtain wall construction , whereby the interior structural elements of floor , columns and roof are entirely encased in insulation materials with no structural member passing .
through this outer covering .
Rigid insulation practices must be rigidly applied to ships , land and transportation facilities , Evaporators for all mechanical installations would be of the modern type providing for de-frosting with warm water ; in ice storage rooms standard pipe coils would be suspended from the ceiling ; brine spray units should be specified in the case of fish receiving rooms .
In the sizes contemplated in this territory the compressor equipment would be of the usual reciprocating type .
Due to the considerable number of small auxiliaries involved the compressors should be driven from electric motors instead of directly connecting them to diesels .
Separate Diesel Electric generating facilities should then be provided where required .
This arrangement provides for flexibility in the progressive development of the collection centre from an ice plant to the ultimate quick freezing and storage arrangement including the necessary single and multiple staging providing for the utmost in standby facilities .
INLAND FACILITES In the case of inland transportation , icing will be used for short hauls , requiring usually one pound of ice for two pounds of fish , cold plates having holdover capacity for longer trips and in the case of very large distribution arrangements mechanical equipment applied to railway waggons or trucks .
.
Each of these problems must be studied individually , keeping in mind , the practical aspects of the individual marketing area .
Distribution of fish to inland centres also require storage plants for holding the periodic receipts of fish from the main fishing centres .
Dealers must also be provided with necessary day to day refrigeration facilities .
All of these applications are fairly well known and the standard equipment far these purposes can be developed for each specific project .
BUDGET COSTS The following figures are given for rough purposes of budgeting costs of any specific project .
The costs of operation include power at Singapore rates and are based on useful life of the equipment as 20 years , they also include for normal maintenance costs .

TYPICAL PLANT The attached diagram and preliminary layout indicates the relationship of a typical plant designed to handle a total daily catch of 30 tons of which 15 tons may be frozen and stored , the remaining tons are sold daily to the local market .
In this instance the ice plant is of 20 tons capacity suitable to ieed trawlers with mechanical refrigeration facilities and provide ice for inland transportation .
The fish storage room has a capacity of 500 tons .
An example of the largest scale projects is the recent contract.signed by Bergen Fisheries , Norway for an installation capable of handling frozen fish and other foods at the rate of 82,000 tons per year .
This plant has a capacity for freezing 300 tons per day and holding in storage 12,000 tons .
In addition it will produce 200 tons of ice per day and has ice storage capacity of 3,000 tons .
The compressors consist of four centrifugal machines of 700 H.P .
the total connected load is 3,200 H.P .
The magnitude of a freezing plant of the latter size should not be required at present in any country in South East Asia .
The average handling capacity whether chilled or frozen would appear to run in the magnitude of 5-30 tons per day .
The power available to drive the machinery in each instance will become a critical factor at this time .
PLANNING The steps which will be required for the regular planning of a central collection centre would be : - Cullection of the statistics for the fishing port in question giving catch by months , present distribution methods and quantities , long term trends , if available would permit closer approximation .
Planning and handling of the distribution under refrigerated methods including arrival at a base quantity to be handled through the refrigerating centre .
Development of quantities of ice required , ice storage facilities and chilled fish reception centre flow diagram .
Preliminary investigation of possible future need for quick freezing and frozen storage including daily freezing rate and total storage facilities .
Detailed layoui and flow diagram to meet the eventual ultimate development of the scheme with plans prepared for each stage of the development assuring full integration in the future of the complete installation .
These steps are best developed with the advice of local refrigeration experts since recommendations on practical applications of equipment to the specific problems of each locality will change and individual studies on the spot may usually be necessary .
A11 of these steps will ensure that no superfluous investment , waste.of space or physical arrangement will occur .

Work concerning fishing exploitation .
The improvements to be brought about in the fishing exploitation are of twd kinds : Some are of a technical character , the others of social character .
For the amelioration of technical character , two series of projects are envisaged .
( ) the study of the financial condition of the fishing undertakings and the possible means of enabling the fishermen to escape from the grasp of the usual usurer .
( b ) the study of a better organisation of the shares for sale by auction , in order to get a more appropriate division of the shares .

Work concerning the rational utilisation of fishing materiais .
These surveys relate chiefly to the following points : ( a ) improvement in the preservation and the conditioning of dry fish .
( b ) improvement in the quality of the oil delivered to the trade and determination of the types of standard quality .
( c ) recovery of the by-products of oil manufacture and salted dry fish and of the small fish as well , having no other use , for the manufacture of fish meal as food for cattle .
( d ) determination of the optimum conditions of manufacture of `` nuoc mam '' from the freshwater fish and of quality equal to the `` nuoc man '' from marine fish .

Survey concerning pisciculture .
It has been decided for the time being not to go any further than the diffusion of the breeding techniques already fixed , particularly in fish culture in the rice fields .
AN OUTLINE OF A PRELIMINARY SURVEY INTO THE SOCIO - ECONOMICS OF THE FISHING INDUSTRY OF HONG KONG by J. Cater 1 .
In taking stock of the industry immediately after the re-occupation of the Colony , it was apparent that the most important problems were .
still economic and social .
.
The great potentialities of the industry were recognised and i t was realised that if a planned economy , on an owner-operative basis , were to be effected , firm , even drastic , action was required .
2 .
The system of marketing had for long been recognised as the basic ill of the industry .
Whilst the industry remained in the hands of a few large wholesalers ( laans ) , further development was not possible .
In the pre-war years the laans had gained control of the industry by financing the improvident fishermen .
When loans were made to the fishermen no contract was signed and interest was seldom charged .
The only condition of the loan was that the fisherman should market his f i ~ h ~ c a t c h t rough the laan .
In this way the laan ma & sure that any profits to be made in the industry went either to him or his subordinates .
The fisherman , in the main , was kept at a bare subsistence level and seldom did he have sufticient funds to enable him to experiment with new gear and methods .
3 .
The action taken by the Hong Kong Government has been described elsewhere ( in the Department 's Annual Report and the paper presented to the Singapore Fisheries Meeting in January , 1947 ) , but , briefly , a Government Marketing Organisation was formed to take over completely the activities of the laans : The organisation had as its first aims a fair return to the fisherman for his labours and a reasonable price to the consumer .
Two wholesale markets were established in the main centres and collecting centres were started in the fishing villages .
These collecting centres ' had as their main function the collection and transportation of fish to the Markets , but they also acted as distribution centres where essential foodstuffs and gear were retailed to fishermen at the lowest possible prices .
They also served as social welfare centres where fishermen could obtain advice on the many and varied problems which face them in their everyday life .
An educational programme was formulated in which Discussion Groups and primary schools were started in the main fishing villages and , on the island of Hong Kong , a Seniur Fisheries Class was established in which students were taught fisheries , navigation , meteorology and other allied subjects .
In two villages medical clinics have been opened for the exclusive use of the fishermen .
A Loan and Savings scheme has been started and , to date , over H.K .
$ 650,000 has been lent to fishermen .
With the advice of the Fisheries Department both consumer and producer cooperatives have been started by small groups of the fishermen .
4 .
The Hong Kong fisherman is both skilful and courageous .
I t is recomised that the next stev ir , develocment must be in ; he mechanisation of t < e industry .
The Department is fully aware of the possible effects that this modernisation may have on the local fishing population , especially with regard to the unemployment problem .
Before embarking on any mechanisation programme , i t was considered essential to carry out survey of the economic and social factors of the industry , in - order that the effects of the impact of any mechanisation on the industry may be known , so that the degree of modernisation in the early stages could be determined and , later on , how any surplus population could be utilised in a planned economy of the indus - try in secondary industries such as fish canning and smoking , net-making and so forth .
In other words , before further development could be planned it was necessary to have a deep understanding of the structure and organisation of the industry , especially with regard to the ability , training , habits and superstitions of the fishermen ; the status of employees and their relationship with their employers ; the finances of the industry and ownership of capital equipment .
5 .
The existence of the Marketing Organisation , with its collecting centres in the main fishing villages , and the compactness of the territory made the carrying out of such a survey in Hong Kong comparatively easy .
Based on the `` Programme of socio-economic research into the Fisheries of South East Asia '' , submitted by Dr. G. L. Kesteven to the October Liaison Officers ' Meeting , a preliminary survey was started in December , 1948 .
A preliminary survey based on a quota sample basis was decided upon as it was desirable that experience be obtained and possible pit-falls be known before atttempting the more extensive survey which is now under consideration .
6 .
Many statistics required for the descriptive phase were available from the records maintained by the marketing organisation , but details as to locality of catch , wages , finance , determination of unit effort and so forth were lacking .
Description and statistics of distribution elements were available mainly from the marketing organisation records and with little research , it was possible to obtain fairly reliable data .
Little had been recorded regarding units of organisation .
In addition it was realised that , for our purposes , the study of the fisherman 's history , customs and superstitions was also essential .
7 .
Representatives from the colleaing centres of the marketing organisation were given detailed instructions as to what was required in the survey and the method of approach for the coIlection of statistics and factors .
These men were well-known to the fishermen for they had , over the past three years , been working with and for the fishermen .
Even so , instructions were given that when information was being obtained from the fishermen the official manner and pencil and paper should be replaced by a friendly manner and a good memory .
8. The sections for study and investigation divided themselves naturally into the technical groups of different classes of boats and equipment .
The first important task was the selection of subjects of study within these groups on a quota sample basis .
Great care and much time were spent on these selections .
Various factors , including standard of education , degree of poverty , race , refigion and so forth were ' taken into consideration .
Care was taken not to select from only those fishermen who would be keen to give information or who were known supporters of the Marketing Organisation .
9 .
The marketing organisation acts as the Government .
agent for the distribution of rationed eoods to the fisherfolk .
A fairlv accurate record u of the numbers of junks and fishermen is maintained for purposes of rationing .
( See Appendix ) .
The selection of groups for investigation was based on this record .
Different classes of boats tend to congregate in different villages , thus we have longline fishermen operating mainly from Shaukiwan on Hong Kong Island , trawler fishermen from Cheung Chan Island and so forth .
Investigation of the groups was assigned , therefore , to the centres on which were based the greater number of different types of vessels .
Classes bf boats and fishermen selected for investigation were : - Purse seiners Shrimp trawlers , Hand liners Big-tail junks , Pa teng , Trawlers ( deep-sea ) , Trawlers ( in-shore ) , Long liners ( Large ) , Long liners ( Medium size ) .
The minimum number selected for investigation in each class was 12 .
10 .
The investigators were instructed to find out literally everything possible , socially and economically , concerning the subject of their investigation .
Detailed pro formas were drawn up on which was to be shown inter aha data as to production , income , expenditure , ~ r ~ anisations , relationship .
Production was to show amount of catch , area in which caught , men engaged , type and design of boat and gear , times net or lines shot and so on ; income was to be taken as the gross money income or the total price offered for the fish catch at the Market-net money would be calculated as gross income Less production costs and real income was to be .
considered in terms of goods , services , supplies and so forth which the money income could purchase ; expenditure was to include production , mar - keting and distribution costs and other expenditure on szrvices , luxury goods and so forth not connected with production and marketing ; organisations of all types were to include the family as a fishing unit , co-operative societies , guilds and so on ; relationships were to be taken as those between the various factors investigated , not only to give a general picture of the organisation of the industry , but also for the effect on movement of supplies and price levels .
11 .
.
I t is too early to attempt to give any details or indications as to socio-economic factors , for the nature of the investigation is such that uniform , systematic enquiries are not possible - - or des i r ab le with the conservative and highly suspicious fisherman .
Sufticient concrete facts to enable the writing of a report are not expected to be available for some two to three months to come .
12 .
In order to obtain a background , .
it was considered desirable to study-if possible-the early history of the fisherman .
Surprisingly little is known-certainly not much has been written-f the Hong Kong fisherman and his antecedents .
The fisherman 's account of his history , although valuable , is too often shrouded in mysticism a i d folk-lore , to be taken as completely reliable , and only fleeting mention is made of Hong Kong fishermen in the Topography .
In the main we are indebted to S.F. Balfour 's `` Hong Kong before the British '' for the following facts .
13 .
The peasant population of Hong Kong consists of four distinct communities known as Tan ka , Hoklo , Punti and Hakka .
14 .
The Tan ka and the Hoklo are the fishermen of the region .
They are thought to be nonChinese in origin , whereas the farmers , the Punti and Hakka , claim to be of pure Chinese stock .
I t is known that the Tan ka were in the Hong Kong area well over 300 years before the first Chinese peasants began to migrate into the region during the Sung dynasty ( A.D. 960 ) .
Although possibly of nonChinese origin , the Tan ka and Hoklo fishermen have been so overwhelmed with Chinese culture that little remains of their original customs .
1 5 .
The Tan ka , for the most part , live in boats .
They support themselves almost entirely by fishing or in subsidiary industries such as net and rope-making .
Very rarely does a Tan ka live onshore .
He is no architect and the nearest he comes to living on-shore is in an unseaworthy vessel that has been pulled up on the beach and is used as a dwelling .
A typical houy-boat community is to be found at Tai 0 in the South Western part of the Colony .
The Tan ka boats , however , are extremely well made and were ' probably evolved as a result of contact with the foreign people , even as late as the Portuguese .
16 .
The Hoklo are to be found mostly in the North Eastern region around Mirs Bay .
The boats are not so well constructed as those of the Tan ka , .
and the Hoklo very often lives on land in small mat-shed villages .
17 .
The Tan ka and Hoklo , then , must be considered as communities apart from the landdwellers .
This is reflected in their obvious dislike of sharing the same schools , medical clinics and so forth .
Although i t may be desirable that the fishermen and land dwellers mix as much as possible , it has been necessary to provide schools for the fishing population alone and a start has been made in two villages to give the fishermen a medical clinic of their own .
18 .
The Tan ka practice of living on their boat3 is likely to have its effects on any attempt at modernisation , especially of the shape of the vessels .
Up to the present , the programme of modernisation in Hong Kong is still in the experimental stage and only a few existing vessels have been mechanised .
But already one can see that junk-masters are reluctant to consider a changeover to a vessel of modern lines .
This no doubt is mainly on account of the fishermen 's natural conservatism , but certainly i t is partly due to the Tan ka 's practice of having his entire family , of up to 30140 people , and household , down to dogs , pigs and chickens , on board boata practical impossibility on a single sized boat of modern design .

1941 ( 1941 ) P 4 5 I ) INTRODUCTION : - From ancient times till the Greek and Romans spoke about `` dejecta vilior the beginning of the XVIIIth century the Occidental algae '' , the Orientals , already in the time of Confuand Oriental peoples differed largely in opinion with cius , considered seaweeds a food of great delicacy .

and the Hawaiians are known as phycophages .
Moreover , in the East algae are used not only as food but also for many other purposes .
After 1800 the industrially-minded Westerners changed their opinion and in several countries exposed to the Atlantic a seaweed industry was started and became prosperous especially in the XXth century .
As a result of this the literature on the economic applications of marine algae increased considerably in the.last forty years .
`` Indeed '' , and I agree fully with Miss Chase 's words quoted - at the top of this paper , `` the seaweeds are not finding repose in this generation '' .
However , a review of the seaweeds used in the islands of the Malay Archipelago does not exist , although Burkill in his invaluable book on the Economic Products of the Malay Peninsula ( 1 93 5 ' ) did not restrict himself to the peninsura proper in his remarks on the utilization of algae .
On account of this , the present author intends to give in this series of papers a survey of the mariine algae economically used in the Malay Archipelago .
The classification of the blue and green seaweeds ( 1935 9 , as follows : Moreover , it seemed advisable to extend this investigation beyond Indonesia to adjacent countries and to take into consideration also the Philippine Islands and the Malay Peninsula .
This vast region covered may be indicated by the term Malaysia , cf. Lam , ( 193P ) ; Van Steenis , ( 19373 ) , Zaneveld , ( 19404 ) .
' In order to make the present survey more easily accessible to non botanists , the genera and species are not arranged taxonomically , but alphabetically .
In the first part ( the present paper ) the Cyanophyta and Chlorophyta are treated , whereas the second part will summarize the Phaeophyta , and finally the third part will deal with the Rhodophyta besides closing with a bibliographic list .
The literature mentioned for the individual species and varieties concerns only the original descriptipn , the place where the recombination of the specific epithet was introduced , and the publications dealing with the economic application of the species involved .
Not included are references to purely taxonomic and ecological matters .

Nevertheless , i t should be remarked that the utilization of marine algae as human food , particularly in the Malay Peninsula and in Indonesia , seems nowadays by no means as general as one would suppose , when reading the earlier authors like Rumphius and Von Martens .
CYANOPHYTA * ( MYXOPHYCOPHYTA ) Note : A careful study was made by Suringar of the use in Japan of an edible Cyanophyte not listed below , viz .
Phylloderma sacrum Suring ; cf. Okamura ( 19336 ) .
Some items may be recapitulated here as the alga probably occurs in Malaysia too .
The plants are gathered from the natural growing places and thoroughly washed with water .
All epiphytes and other adhering matter are removed with pincers and then the weed is chopped up .
After that , the mass is crushed and made into a paste by kneading it with a trowel .
Then this paste is spread over unglazed tiles in the sun .
When dry i t is peeled off the tiles in thin paper-like sheets .
For use , these sheets are cut into small strips and soaked in water until they swell up , when they are ready for use .
As I was informed by Mr. W. H. Schuster , Adviser on Fisheries , Batavia , the vernacular name `` keklap '' is used by the Javanese people to indicate the free floating Cyanophyte colonies .
These colonies mainly consist of Oscillatoria species , but Nostoc species are sometimes also extant .
The colonies incl .
the detritus are eaten by fishes .

Use : The species is used on the north coast of Java as a remedy for gallstone , renal calculi , and stones in the bladder .
This is probably due to the capability of the rhizoids to secret acids ( Boorsma 1913 , 1 .
c. ) .
An annotation given on the label of a specimen extant in the Buitenzorg Herbarium mentions that after chewing the alga for two minutes a piece of glass was completely masticated without any damage to the mouth and tongue .
Cf. also Beumee ( I. c. ) .
BURKILL ( I .

Its employment is by homoeopathic magic .
'' Caulerja LAMOUROUX .
( Order : Siphonales .
Fam .
: Caulerpaceae ) The colourless rhizomes are attached to'sand or to dead pieces of coral by means of colourless rhi - zoids .
The rhizomes give rise to a great number of green shoots , which are simple and phylloids , or exhibit axis bearing ramuli of various shapes .
A large , widely distributed genus in the tropics .
Most of the species occur in the shallow water of the littoral region below low tide level ( baso - and semi littoral belt ; cf. ( 1937 9 ) , prefpably in lagoons protected by coral reefs .

Chaetomorpha KUETZING ( Order Cladophorales .
Fams Cladophoracea ) The plants are $ omposed of unbranched filaments , which sometimes fasten themselves by means of more or less branched rhizoids ; in other species , h o m e r , they are not attached at all , the filaments being twisted together forming intricate clumps , resting on stones or other algae .
The genus is found both in the sea and in brackish water all over the world .
Mainly attached to rocks in the littodl zone ( ultra-littoral belt ) .
Note : The arrangement of this genus in the order Cladophorales is in accordafice with Fritsch ( 1935 1 3 ) .
More frequently i t is placed to the order Siphonocladiales .

The erect , richly dichotomously branched threads of the plants are anchored by a small cushionlike disk or by tufts of rhizoids on coral reefs or on exposed rocks in the surf ( littoral region ) .
Note : I n the Hawaiian Islands and in Japan , ~ eside Codium tomentoszrm ( see below ) , species of Codium other than are meritioned below are used .
Miller ( 1946 47 ) stated that especially Codium Mulleri Kuetz .
5s eaten raw , usually with tomatoes , after being thoroughly washed in fresh water .
I t is never cooked or blanched , for it becomes soft and distintegrates quickIy with heat .
- Moreover , Miller states : '' The ascorbic acid content of a specimen which had been kept in sea water in a refrigerator for 2 days after gathering was found to be low : only 1 mg of ascorbic acid per 100 grams `` .
The vernacular names of this species are : aalaula , limi wawaeiole , limu wawaimoa ( Hawaii ) ; popoklo ( Philippines : Luzon ( Ilocos Prov .
) ) ; silingsiling ( Philippines : I. of Leyte , Cebu , Bokol ( Visayan dialect ) ) .
The method of preserving Codizlm species for food in Japan , is to put them in salt ( OKAMURA ( 1933 ' 9 ) .

Okamura ( 1933 17 ) states that species .
of Codium , e.g. C. tomentosum are copied as designs in fine arts .
One of the plants is neatly straightened out on paper in a flabellate form , then copied arid used as a pattern on porcelain , fabric , wall paper , etc. E & eronrorPha LINK ( Order : Ulotrichales .
Fam .
: Ulvaceae ) Thallus of the plants tubular , simple or with more or less numerous branches .
The species occur in the upper parts of the littoral zone near the shore in quiet waters , ' attached to small stones and rocks by means of rhizoids .
Enteromorpha species are capable of enduring a wide range of salinity , therefore often occurring in brackish water of estuaries .
The 3 species mentioned below are ' very closely allied ; cf. Weber-van Bosse ( 19 13 IS ) .
Note : An extensive study of the food value of the Hawaiian Enteromorpha species was made by Miller ( 192 7 '' ) .
The edible species are known as Kmu ele-ele or limu pipilani .
A chemical analysis of an Enteromorpha species gave the following result ( p. 19 ) : Water 90.34 ' j6 Protein ( N x 6.25 ) 2.82 % Fat ( ether extract ) 0.0485 % Ash l. $ 9 yo Calcium 0.17 % Phosphorus 0.0336 % As to the vikmin contents Miller stated ( p. 24 ) : `` Limu ele-ele is a fairly good source of vitamin A and a less good source of vitamin B.
The value of limu in diet is its flavor and its tendency to prevent constipation .
Limu ele-ele has no antiscorbutic value '' - Species of Enteromorpha are food for many fishes e.g. Chanos chanos ( bandeng ) .

Use : Though Ulva lactuca is a common plant in the whole of Malaysia it is mentioned only by Burkill .
However , this author states that the sea lettuce is eaten widely in the East , in soup , as a salad and that it is employed for garnishing .
On account of this it is somewhat surprising that no vernacular names are reported from these rgions .
In Hawaii ( Reed , 1907 22 ) i t is called by the natives limu lipalahalaha and in Japan ( OKAMURA , 193 3 `` ) awosa-awosa .
In Singapore the plant is used only for feeding pigs .
I t may be that it is neglected there as human food because '' the sea water is not a little polluted `` .
Tressler ( 1923 24 , 112 ) gave an analysis showing that 50 % of carbohydrates are present and 15 % of proteins if water be reduced to 19 % .

' HE PELAGIC FISHERIES OF THE WORLD Part I : GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS BY H. Srinivasa Rao INTRODUCTION I t has been a great privilege to be asked to open the discussion on the World Pelagic Fisheries in the symposium arranged by Dr. G. L. Kesteven as part of the proceedings of the Singapore Inaugural Meeting of the Indo-Pacifi ~ Fisheries Council .
The literature on the subject is very extensive , and scattered in many books , journals and periodicals published in the five continents .
Owing to the shortness of notice for the preparation of the paper , it has not been possible to review any but a fraction of the literature on the subject , and no one is more conscious than myself of the incompleteness and inadequacy of the paper presented .
I hope , however , that the more salient features of the subjecx : have been touched upon in this brief review , and that these will lead to a fruitful discussion .
I should like to take this opportunity to offer my sincerest thanks to Dr. G. L. Kesteven , F.A.O. Regional Representative ( Fisheries ) for every encouragement and for readily placing at my disposal a list of bibliography on the subject which lie had prepared , and to my colleague , Dr. N. K. Panikkar who , a t very short notice , was able to get together a considerable part of the locally available literature at Madras and to prepare a .
general connected account of the biology of pelagic fishes from his own and my notes on the subject .
The paper is presented in two parts : ( 1 ) General considerations of the pelagic environment as influenced by latitude , climate , currents , tides , and the biological and physico-chemical contents of the sea and their influence on fish and fisheries ; ( 2 ) Biology of pelagic fishes , chiefly of the shoaling forms such as herring , mackerel , horse-mackexel , flying fish , so far as is known and has been possible to gather in the short time at our disposal .
Geograjhical .
The pelagic region of the divisions of oceans is a part of the marine biothe oceans .
cycle of the world which may be divided geographically into two main divisions , viz ( 1 ) the Atlantic with its connections in the North and the South with the Arctic and Antarctic waters respectively , and the associated partially land-girt seasthe North Sea , the Baltic Sea , the Mediterranean Sea , the Gulf of Mexico and the Carribbean Sea , and ( 2 ) the Pacific and Indian Oceans with their connections in the South with the Antarctic , and with a northern connection for the former Ocean with the Arctic by the Behring Sea .
The Red Sea , the Arabian Sea , the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea , the China Sea , the Sulu Sea , and the Java , Sunda , Arafura , Banda and Celebes Seas of the East Indies and the Japan and Yellow Seas are more or less land-bounded .
Oceans of the The oceanic mass of water world as a thus constitutes for marine organcorr tinuous isms a sinrrle continuous domain L. domain for whose populations are , as a rule , ef marine organ - greater density in the upper strata isms .
of water than the lower , and exhibit in the former a greater diversity of form and organisation .
With the exception of a few of the higher forms of life such as the seals , whales , dolphins , turtles , snakes , which have secondariIy adapted themselves to life in the sea , the majority of sea organisms have the ocean as their original home .
This marine domain or bio-cycle has been estimated to have about 300 times the habitable space provided by the terrestrial and fresh water biocycles together .
I t may be broadly divided into the primary and secondary biotic divisi0.n ~ based upon the physical nature of the sea or upon the nature of the biota .
- Physical and The two primary divisions of biological the oceans are ( I ) the benthic indivisions of cluding all the ocean floor and ( 2 ) the oceans .
the pelagic including the whole mass of water .
Although this article deals specifically with the latter division , the physical and biological continuity of the marine domain or bio-cycle makes it necessary that the characteristic features of both the divisions be taken into account if the significance of factors affecting pelagic fisheries is to be fuily understood .
The pelagic division is further sub-divided into the hTeritic and the Oceanic regions corresponding to the littoral and the abyssal sub-divisions of the benthic , in reference to the depths to which light penetrates the neritic and oceanic regions and to the extent and depth of the continental shelf .
These are not , how - ever , absolute divisions as depth of penetration of light in the neritic region may be affected by the turbidity conditions of the sea and the extent of the continental shelf may be correlated with the geological formation of land masses and the extent of terrigenous deposits brought in by rivers .
Physical and Fishes of both the benthic and biological the pelagic divisions of the ocean characteris - have to depend for .
their sustenance tics of the on the organisms and organic subbenthic div - stances produced in it either in the isions of the form of plants or animals or in sea .
the form of organic detritus .
The benthic division from the shore to the abyss is usually covered by sedimentary terrigenous deposits , organic or pelagic oozes , and red clay .
Except for the fact that the deep sea deposits , consisting of nutrient organic and inorganic matter , may be brought within the range of the neritic region by upwelling and currents in the ocean , the terrigenous deposits restricted to the configuration of the continental shelf seem to influence the greater productive capacity of the coastal region in reference to fisheries .
Plants are the real sustainers of animal life in the sea in general , and the production and distribution of plants in the sea depend upon a great variety of factors chief among which are light and available nutriment in the biotic division in which they occur .
The eulittoral zone of the benthic division which can support large attached plants constitutes only about two per cent of the sea floor , and even here unfavourable substratal conditions restrict the production of such plants , The function of primary food production in the sea therefore devolves on the unattached floating plants , e.g. phyto-plankton-such as , algae , diatoms , aagellates , coccolithophores , etc. which occur in enormous numbers .
The phytoplankton may be divided broadly into neritic and oceanic populations .
As the conditions of salinity , temperature , turbidity and other environmental factors vary considerably in the neritic region as contrasted with the more stable conditions in the oceanic region , it may be supposed that phytoplankton production in the coastal belt may be adversely affected , but in actual fact the waters of the neritic region are believed to be fifty times more productive than the open oceanic waters ( Lohmann , 1908 ) as substantiated by the abundant benthic and pelagic fauna in the former .
The production of phyto-plankton is in general conditioned by light and latitude , and by available nutrients in solution .
The source of these nutrients in solution in neritic or oceanic waters is the decomposing plants and animals brought down from land or present in the sea .
It has been shown that the ~ e r i ~ h ~ t i c bacterial population of pelagic waters has a tendency to follow closely the distribution of plankton ensuring thereby the thorough decomposition of dead planktonic organisms even before they have had time to sink to great depths and the regeneration of mineralized plant nutrients in the upper layers of water both in and below the eu ~ hot ic zone .
The upper layers of water have however a relatively poor concentration of nutrients as compared to the bottom layers , more particularly in the interface between mud and water , unless augmented with nutrients from the bottom by processes of vertical diffusion , convection overturn and upwelling .
Biological The oceanic pelagic life is characteris - made up of animals independent tics of the of the bottom throughout their oceanic regions development ( Radiolarians , Foraof the pelagic minifera , Hydromedusae , Siphonodivision .
phores , Ctenophores , Chaetognaths , .
copepods and hyperines among crustacea , heteropods , pteropods , appendicularians , salps , pyrosomas , some sharks ; a great number of bony fishes with air-bladder and some without , and the whales ) .
The neritic pelagic includes , in addition to the above , animals which are dependent on the bottom during part of their existence ( medusae with alternating generations , Iarvae of benthic animals , floating eggs of many fishes , water fleas , Podon & Evadne whose eggs sink to the bottom , and the ostracod Philomedes and numerous other free-living crustacea ) .
Many cephalopods , most sharks and rays , many bony fishes of the neritic pelagic are included which rest at the bottom at night .
The sea turtles , seals and walruses which belong to the pelagic region feed on benthic forms .
The time and season of dependence on the bottom vary with different animals so that periodic changes in the composition of the neritic pelagic are much more pronounced than the.oceanic .
The outer seaward boundary of the neritic pelagic , is generally the 200 metre contour of the benthic region , and includes the banks as well as coastal waters .
This boundary is the obvious result of dependence on.the bottom .
Inhabitants of the neritic and oceanic pelagic are usually mixed at the boundary , and currents carry nexitic forms out and oceanic ones in , generally to their destruction , although the eels are a notable exception .
As the Maximum production of phytoplankton is restricted to the lighted zone , animals of the pelagic region , whether aduit or lgvae , which permanently or temporarily live in i t to feed on phytoand zoo-plankton , will be restricted to the lighted zone .
All true pelagic animals are independent of the bottom in that they have the ability to main - tain themselves in open water without sinking .
Some animals like the ctenophores never sink to the bottom , while many elements in the pelagic fauna are larvae of animals which spend their adult life in the benthic region .
Where the pelagic or benthic period is very short the animals must be reckoned as benthic or pelagic respectively as the case may be .
Mackerel which unquestionably belong to the pelagic region are known to spend part of the year resting on - the bottom .
Economy in the use of hard skeletal matter such as lime , and silica , the absorption of large amounts of water in the jelly-like tissues , storage of lighter materials such as water of less salinity , fat , or even air in the tissues , the accumulation of fat , oil or air in the bodies or eggs are devices to help obviate the natural tendency of pelagic animals to sink .
The bony fishes and the air-breathing sea vertebrates such as turtles , snakes , whales , sirenians , and seals of the pelagic region have solved their respective buoyancy problems in the pelagic region by the development of an air-bladder and by retention of their lungs .
The retardation of sinking by changes in form is widespread phenomenon among pelagic invertebrates .
Flattened leaf-like form , susvensorv .
* bristles , long tentacles and , appendages are among the means of suspension .
Resistance to water produced by active muscular swimming is , howcver , the most widespread means of preventing sinking .
In the fastest swimmers such as the blue shark and the mackerel every device calculated to reduce the resistance of the moving body to water is employed .
The viscosity factor in water , which depends chiefly on temperature but less markedly on salinity is also of importance in reducing the rate of sinking .
The pelagic animals of the Polar regions and of the oceanic depths with more or less identical viscosity conditions are , therefore , better able to suspend themselves in water than ' those of the tropical regions .
The variation of viscosity with temperature may bear upon the fact that many pelagic organisms are smaller in warm seas than in cold , but notable exceptions to this have been recorded amongst diatoms ( Wimpenny , 1936-37 ) .
Characteris - Free swimming forms of the tics of pelagic which are independent of plankton and oceanic currents are grouped as nekton .
nekton to distinguish them from the passively floating or suspended plankton , but no sharp distinction can be maintained between these two groups of animals .
Such independence is reached only by certain fishes ( tunny , bonito , etc. ) , cephalopods , reptiIes and the homoiothermal marine mammals .
Both plankton and nekton include predaceous and herbivorous forms and cannot be distinguished on the criterion provided by food habits .
Methods of Special means of securing food procurement are required by pelagic animals of food by since their food differs from that Pelagic of benthic animals .
The predatory animals .
pelagic animals of this region , however , employ the usual methods of chase and capture .
The basic food supply is provided by the phyto-plankton for a variety ' of organisms such as the pelagic protozoa , copepods and even larger animals like whales etc.
The large lank ton animals , from small metazoa to the size of pteropods , form the food of larger pelagic animals .
A special apparatus for plankton collection has been developed convergently in the plankton feeders-which are divided into ( 1 ) those which feed by sticky tentacles , ( 2 ) those which produce a current of water which carries food .
and ( 3 ) those which hunt \ , actively .
A divergent group of animals strains out living animals from a stream of water produced by themselves ( Cladocera and copepods , salps and pyrosomas , the remarkable apparatus of a ~ ~ endicularians , the sieve-like strainers of the plankton-eating fishes such as herring or the giant sharks , and the baleen of the toathless whales ) .
The perma - Exclusively pelagic animals are nent & elagic the radiolarians , medusae , siphonobiota .
phores , ctenophores , Chaetognatha , pelagic crustacea and Mollusca ( Heteropoda and Pteropoda , lanthinu and Phylliroe ) , salps and appendicularians .
Amongst these the pelagic copepod crustaceans predominate , comprising 90 % of the whole fauna with schizopod , decapod and other forms in addition .
Next come the pteropods , siphonophores and Chaetognatha while cephalo ~ o d s and fishes are an im ~ or tan t element .
The microplankton ( constituting what is known as nannoplankton ) and macroplankton also form part of this biota .
Wind and currents play a large part in the wide distribution of pelagic animals which remain in free suspension in water .
Those endowed with feeble powers of swimming are no exception to this mode of distribution .
Among longer-lived animals aggregations appear which may be due to instinctive gregariousness as in schools of herring , mackerel , cod , etc. wandering to feeding or spawning grounds .
Composition of plankton varies with time as well as locality .
I t is usually composed of a great number of ditferent animals but a t a given place and special time a single species may flourish to such an degree that i t predominates to the extent of being termed a monotonous plankton .
This is especially a phenomenon of the shallow seas more particularly of the colder waters lying over them .
There is difference in the composition of the surface plankton between day and night .
A t night numerous deep sea forms come to the surface even from great depths to return before day break .
These are followed by predatory forms which live oti them .
The schools of herring come to the surface at night , remaining at considerable depths during the day .
This suggests possible success in tropical latitudes of surface fishing by night and or of deep-sea seining by day .
Deep bays , fiords , lagoons of corai reefs operate like traps for plankton and destroy them .
Oceanic and neritic plankton suffer in storms and are driven ashore in great masses .
The difference in density of marine populations in the oceanic and neritic regions is much greater than between those of the polar and tropical regions .
This may be due to the greater food supply in shallow water brought about by the greater deyelopment of phytoplankton as a result of the accumulation of organic and inorganic deposits from land .
The pelagic population is more or less self-sustaining , the food chain of which , from the smallest single-celled alga to the largest fish and toothed whales , is extensive and conditions the distribution of the larger forms of animal life .
The mackerel fishery a t the mouth of the English Channel depends on the amount of animal plankton , especially copepods ; the appearance of the herring gn the north coast of Iceland depends on the summer development of the copepod Calanus , and the complicated migration of the herring ( except spawning migrations ) and the movement of schools of whales seem to be dominated by their food supply .
In open and warm seas the zooplankton lies at a deeper level on which large crustaceans and cephalopods feed which in turn form the food of the larger pelagic animals such as sperm whales .
Effect of The pelagic habitat or biotope currents on is influenced considerably by the clistri - oceanic currents and eddies more bution of .
particularly in the distribution of pelagic its inhabitants .
Both passive and animals .
free swimming forms are affected by them .
The study of surface currents has shown that they may form an open or closed circuit .
A closed current returns its animals through a wide range oi temperature and enviroriment as in the case of Calanus finmarchicus of the Norwegian Sea affected by the Gulf Stream .
The closed circuits of the North and South Atlantic take about one to two years to return the plankton to its place of origin .
The period is long enough to include several generations of short-lived plankton in addition to those larger animals with longer periods of development .
The non circulating warm currents like the gulf stream or the Japan current and the cold currents like the Labrador current or Humboldt current or the Ojashie current provide different conditions of life for the , - oelaeic animals which come within their A `` range and , where warm and cold currents meet , the contrast in temDerature and volumes of water which .
oppose may cause great mortality among plankton as it happens on many banks ( New England , Agulhas , Spitzbergen and East Coast of .
Japan ) : This massive and extensive destruction of pelagic life may cause a temporary scarcity of life in that region but this provides an opportunity for the bottom fauna to thrive on the remains of the pelagic fauna , and for the phytoplankton to derive its nourishment from nutrients liberated by the disintegrating plankton which sink to the bottom .
The dankton carried along by currents changes its composition .
as i t goes along as a result of admixture from adjoining sources .
but some of these have their characteristic plankton ( index forms ) by which the currents could be demarcated in the open ocean ( cf. Calanus hyperhoreus of the polar current north of Iceland and C. finmarchicz ~ s of the Norwegian Sea ) .
Large numbers of animals are often found to accumulate at the borders of currents ( Salpa jlagellifera on the border of Benguela current and pteropods on the borders of great currents ) , Macroscopic Algae provided with floating floatiag algae bladders ( Sargassum of the North constitute a Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific , pelagic ben - Macrocystis of the South Pacific ) thos or pseu - may be carried into a quiet whirl doben tbos pool forming a special biotope of in surface the pelagic ( eddy of the Atlantic waters .
Sargasso Sea ) .
The algae constitute the home of a number of littoral animals from the Caribbean Sea even when they reach the eddy area on the high seas .
The changes from the littoral to the half pelagic life in the Sargasso eddy being so radical for many of the animals miginally attached to the weeds , the fauna in the Sargasso Sea is poor in species but rich in individuals .
The animals living on the weeds constitute a pseudobenthos .
A number of unexplained faunal parallels exists between the fauna of the Sar - gasso Sea and that of the ~ editerranean Sea in the composition of the nannoplankton , in the forms of certain Radiolarians , Annelids , and Copepods .
The Sargasso Sea is characterised by poverty of plankton , transparency of water , high temperature of water at depths between 200 to 400 meters in comparison to temperatures at corresponding depths in adjacent waters due probably to the greater density of surface water which is carried down to oceanic depths compensating in parts for the upwelling currents on leeward coasts .
The eupbotic The , pelagic environment may and dysjhotic also be considered in two different strata of the major strata : kelagic region .
( 1 ) The richly lighted euphotic stratum varying in depth , according to different authorities , from 0 to 100 metres , and ( 2 ) the weakly lighted dysphotic stratum varying in depth from 30 to 500 metres .
The majority of shoaling pelagic fish belongs to the euphotic stratum while some species wander from the one to the other keeping track of the vertically moving plankton .
The animal communities of the sea are extensive life zones comparable to the climatic zones of the continents , but in area , hoinogeneity of environmental factors , and the associated biata they surpass the latter .
These communities may be subdivided into two main groups-of warm and cold waters corresponding roughly to the tropical and sub-tropical areas and the cold polar and temperate areas .
The indistinct and ill-marked boundaries between these are determined by isotherms of surface water rather than by latitudes .
But there has been some difference of opinion between authorities ( Ortmann & Meisenheirner ) as to the limits of these boundaries .
According to the latter the tropical animal communities of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans are united around S. Africa but according to the former entirely separated by .
the South African continent .
Division of The warm and cold regions of the oceans the sea can be sub-divided based into temp - upon the reactions of marine anierature belts .
maIs which seein to recognise an equatorial belt of water with a temperature above 2F0 C. as distinkt from the relatively cooler waters lying on either side of this belt with a temperature range of 20 '' to 25 `` C.
The colder waters around the poles with temperatures below 10 '' C. form a distinct belt from the Iess cold watets with a temperature range of 10 `` to 15 '' C.
The North Atlantic region which has been better studied than others can be divided still further based on the distinctive animal communities designated as Arctic and Boreal .
In the open ocean itself temperature barriers with indistinct and varying seasonal boundaries exist in the regions affected by circulating or terminating streams of cold or warm water , and the pelagic animal cornmunities associated with these seem to keep pace with these changes in boundaries .
Seasonal periodicity in the pelagic biota and their composition in tropical d cold waters .
thermal , animal growth are so ac Seasonal periodicity which is so characteristic of the circumpolar waters seeins to be lacking in the warm waters of the equatorial belt , but this has its advantages as well as disadvantages .
The more constant warmth seems to keep the extensive propagation of a steno - community whose metabolism and xelerated as to quicken the process of succession in animal generations favouring mutations which give rise to a large number of genera and species .
In colder waters , this variety which adds to the numbers of a generation is compensated for by a larger number of individuals of the few species that occur .
Pelagic fisheries in the warmer yaters therefore provide a laxger variety of fishes which is no disadvantage from the commercial point of view , but present difficulties in the scientific interpretation of fisheries .
The depth to which liaht penetrates in `` A the tropics would presumably extend the vertical range of pelagic fisheries , suggesting the adoption of methods of catching fish different from those in vogue in colder waters , where the concentration of pelagic fish in surface waters is understandable .
The following members of the pelagic communities in tropical seas indicate the great variety of forms which provide food ' for pelagic fish : Foraminifera ( 20 species as against 1 or 2 in coIder seas ) , Siphonophora , geryonid Hydromedusae , charybdacid Scyphomedusae , alcyopid Polychaeta , Copepoda ( Coj i - lia ) Eupkusia , Swgestes and Lucifer among Crustacea , the Heteropoda , Pteropoda and the pelagic Ianthina and Phylliroe among the molluscs , Pyrosoma Salpa , and Appendicularia among tunicates , the Exocoetidae among fish , besides a whole host of free swimming larvae of corals , echinoderms , molluscs , worms , crustaceans and fish .
The low temperatures of the colder waters seem to result in the reduction of fertility of animals although compensated for by the size of the eggs and in the suppression of the free-swimming larval forms which while retarding wider dispersal result in enormous over-crowding by the more successful members of the benthic communities .
The Hydrozoa among Coelenterata , the Holothuroidea among Echinodermata and siliceous sponges among Porifera are among the groups of ' animals which seem to find favourable conditions of existence in the colder waters .
The higher crustacea apart from genera like Acanthephyrd are usually absent , while copepods-many of them distinct from those in tropical waters - - occur in enormous numbers of individuals favouring the growth of fish which mainly feed on them .
The schizopods , hyperiids and pteropods are also characteristic of colder waters .
The richness of diatoms in these waters explains the abundance of organisms like Radiolaria and Ciliata which use lots of siliceous skeletal material .
A definite periodicity exists in the plankton of colder waters which are richer in plankton in the summer .
Whether this production of plankton in colder waters over an entire year is greater than that of the tropical waters over a similar period is still unascertained , and the prevailing view , that the tropical seas are quantitatively poorer in plankton than the colder , based on somewhat meagre observations and vague generalisations , which holds the field , merits re-examination .
In any case con + parisons of the populations of pelagic regions of the tropical and colder seas appear to have been made on the basis of information obtained for the Atlantic Ocean only where difference in density of population may not be due to .
temperature alone .
Moreover , the Indo-Pacific Seas , which are in more open communication with the Antarctic and Arctic Oceans and have a much longer coastline skirting them , broken by numerous bays , gulfs , rivers and estuaries , may possibly have as rich a pelagic fauna as that of the equatorial Atlantic .
The richness of life in the pelagic region of the colder seas attracts a large number of birds , mammal predators such as penguins ,. whales , seals , etc. - a phenomenon little in evidence in the open warmer seas where abundant plankton such as is known in the Indian Ocean occurs , but here the corresponding surface feeders are the shark , the porpoises , etc. Bipolarity or the similarity of the pelagic organisms of the Arctic and Antarctic waters has been observed in & my groups of organisms but none of the explanations ?
ffered for this phenomenon can be said to have received universal approval .
A compromise between the opposing views suggested is to treat the similarity between the polar faunas as primary and the differences as secondary .
Conditions The smaller areas of the ocean of pelagic life such as seas , bays and gulfs appear in virtually for all practical purposes as sepaenclosed seas .
rate areas with their distinctive temperature , salinity and biological conditions .
The discharge of large rivers which controls salinity , latitude which determines the evaporation , and topography which may determine the extent of exchange of waters between such isolated parts and the ocean are factors influencing the fauna .
While in the polar sea salinity is decreased in summer by the melting of ice ; in the tropical seas the increase in salinity in summer is due to increased evaporation .
In the deep basins like those of the Baltic , the Mediterranean ( Levantine and Ionian Seas ) , and the Red Sea , animal life becomes sparse owing to poverty of dissolved oxygen and richness of carbon dioxide .
In certain seas like the Black Sea the fauna is affected still further by large amounts of hydrogen sulphide in solution as a result of inadequate circulation of water .
Chemistry of Considerable advances have sea-water in been made in recent years in our relation to knowledge of the chemistry of seaplankton .
water in relation to the plankton and especially the factors which determine the productivity of the sea .
In the earlier section reference was made to the effect of light , temperature and turbulence on the growth of phytoplankton .
The second aspect which requires examination is the influence which the concentrations of nutrient salts in seawater have on the rate of growth and multiplication of the plant life that constitutes the phyto-plankton .
When diatoms grow they utilize phosphates and the available nitrogen compounds-nitrates , nitrite , ammonium , uric acid , urea and probably amino acids-until these substances reach a concentration so low that pIant life cannot grow and multiply in the normal manner .
When only low concentrations of these nutrient salts are available the plankton production would be low .
In the colder seas the burst of diatom activity in spring followed by the zoo-plankton peak results in the depletion of nutrients from seawater , but the inactivity during winter months results in accumulation and regeneration of nutrients which in their turn .
are used up during the succeeding spring .
A cycle of this - type does not exist in tropical waters owing to the absence of winter ; consequently , the large annual variations in phosphates and nitrates observed in the colder seas are not encountered in the tropics .
This does not mean that seasonal variations are totally absent .
Changes in the direction of currents , winds and the upwelling of waters which they produce often result in seasonal variations which in their turn affect the plankton and fisheries .
In addition to nutrient salts small amounts of iron for plant pigments , silicates for the shells of diatoms , carbon dioxide for photosynthetic activity and probably other trace elements are essential for the growth of phyto-plankton .
The foregoing general considerations based on available data would seem to explain partly the pre - sent distribution of pelagic fisheries of the world .
The severity of northern climates , which does not help production of adequate agricultural crops , must have also contributed to the greater concentration on the part of the peoples of these climates on fisheries as i n industry , and traditions of feeding and clothing changed only very slowly under compelling circumstances .
The abundance of food in regions with highly develaped agricultural , horticultural and livestock industries in certain tropical and sub-tropical regions seems BIOLIOGRAPHY .
to have led to the relative neglect of coastal waters as sources of food .
Almost the entire east coast of S. America ( Brazil , Argentina , etc. ) , many parts of Africa , Asia and Australia provide examples of unexploited or inadequately exploited waters for fisheries where food from agricultural and other sources has been available for a great majority of the populations , In these areas fisheries provide accessory food , not'an important item of food as in the countries of the temperate and boreal regions .

Part 11 : THE BIOLOGY OF PELAGIC FISHES N. Kesava Panikkar .
THE HERRINGS AND ANCHOVIES .
Both in numbers and in economic value the fishes be !
onging to the family Clupeidae rank first among the food fishes of the world .
They are represented in all temperate and tropical seas and often form large shoals swimming on the surface and performing long migratory journeys .
Although most of them are marine , there are a few species which occur in freshwater and , a still larger number that ascend rivers at some phase of their life history .
The pelagic species , which are more in the habit of forming shoals than the coastal and estuarine species , are mostly of a small size and , at any rate , never exceed a foot in length .
In fact , most species are much smaller and , especially so are the tropical forms averaging from 4 to 8 inches ; their economic value would have been negligible but for the enormous numbers in which they appear , providing a source not only of edible fish ,, but also of fish oil , fish meal and fish manure .
This group comprising about sixty species includes the herrings of the North Atlantic , the true sardines of S. Europe , S. America , the Pacific and S. Africa , the menhaden of Atlantic coasts of America , the sprat , the pilchard and the closely related forms shoaling along the coasts of S. Europe , West Africa , India , the Far East , Australia and New Zealand .
Taxonomic Dificulties .
The taxonomy of clupeids presents considerable divergence of views .
The earlier workers distinguished , only one genus CEupea for the herring , the sprat , the pilchard , the shad and the many other sardines but in recent years this
Fishery biology , which may perhaps be defined as the study of fish populations as resources for use by man has grown , almost during our lifetimes , into a practically full-fledged scientific discipline .
Pursuit of research in this field requires a system of observation and analysis using a combination of skills as distinct from those of other branches of biology as are the techniques of bacteriology or genetics .
Its principle flaw to this claim is a lack of its own text and handbooks .
Even now there are signs of filling this lack .
I may refer to Kesteven 's ( 1946 ) `` A procedure of investigation in fisheries biology '' , Ricker 's ( 1948 ) `` Methods of estimating vital statistics of fish populations '' , Thompson 's ( 1937 ) `` Theory of the effect of fishing on the stock halibut '' , and Russell 's ( 1942 ) little book `` The overfishing problem '' as indicative of what might be chapters in a future text - - or handbook .

METHODS OF BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH ON PELAGIC FISHERIES RESOURCES by Oscar E. Sette Fishery biology , which may perhaps be defined as the study of fish populations as resources for use by man has grown , almost during our lifetimes , into a practically full-fledged scientific discipline .
Pursuit of research in this field requires a system of observation and analysis using a combination of skills as distinct from those of other branches of biology as are the techniques of bacteriology or genetics .
Its principle flaw to this claim is a lack of its own text and handbooks .
Even now there are signs of filling this lack .
I may refer to Kesteven 's ( 1946 ) `` A procedure of investigation in fisheries biology '' , Ricker 's ( 1948 ) `` Methods of estimating vital statistics of fish populations '' , Thompson 's ( 1937 ) `` Theory of the effect of fishing on the stock halibut '' , and Russell 's ( 1942 ) little book `` The overfishing problem '' as indicative of what might be chapters in a future text - - or handbook .
A full review of methods of research on pelagic fishes would include all chapters of such an hypothetical future text on fishery biology , for I can think of no aspect of research in fishery biology which would not have its bearing on the study of pelagic fish and fisheries .
I t is manifestly impossible to produce here the text book of tomorrow and I shall not attempt to do so .
In some twenty-odd years of personal study on certain pelagic fishes , principally the mackerel of the Western North , Atlantic and the pilchard or sardine of the Western North Pacific , with nearly as many years of sharing with others the problem of selecting and devising methods of research on fishes of the inshore and the demersal groups , I have become not only impressed by the difficulties in studying the pelagic group , but almost obsessed with the need to devise new techniques and approaches .
This is my apology for emphasizing the defects and inadequacies of existing methods at the cost of neglecting some of the very indispensable but thoroughly conventional elements that must form the major part of any well-balanced programme of investigation .
For the latter I refer you again to Dr. Kesteven 's paper .
I shall take i t for granted that the ultimate objective of fishery research is to find out the potential productivity of a fish population serving as a food resource .
That is , we are interested in the populations , not the individuals , and we are interested in the population 's capacity to replace the added mortality imposed by fishing .
Moreover , we would like to know how high this added mortality can be raised to produce the maximum amount of food and still be replaced by the natural powers of regeneration of the stock .
Clearly , this is a matter of birth and growth rates , balancing losses through fishing and from natural mortality and we may use the terni population dynamics to designate the subject .
The study of population dynamics has received considerable impetus in recent years through the formulation of theory concerning the reaction of fish populations to the strains of fishing .
A whole series of papers has been published , beginning with Baranov ( 1918 , 1921 ) and followed by Russell ( 1931 ) , Thompson and Bell ( 1934 ) , Graham ( 1935 , 1938 ) , Thompson ( 1937 ) , Silliman ( 1934 ) , Ricker ( 1940 , 1944 , 1948 ) , and others .
The theory , expressed largely iri mathematical terms , is now so welldeveloped that , given certain suitable fishing records and suitable samples of the catch , one can compute the natural mortality , the fishing mortality , the recruitment , and the numbers in the total population .
Where it is possible to conduct tagging operations and get returns on a sufficiently quantitative basis , similar computations are possible .
I t is my opinion that the theory is .
so far advanced that the great problem now is to get the suitable fishing records and the suitable samples of the catch or to conduct proper tagging programs or both .
All of this is , I think , so difficult for pelagic fish populations that the application of the modern concepts of population dynamics to most pelagic fish populations must await further progress on the more rudimentary features of the problem .
RACES OR SUB-POPULATIONS First of these is to find out whether one is studying a fishery based on stock of fish that is homogeneously mixed throughout the range of the fishery or whether there are several independent populations involved .
Two techniques have wide use in the study of races and migrations , and both have been applied to pelagic fisheries ., They are morphometrics and marking .
Both have inherent difficulties and limitations when applied to pelagic fishes .
Morphomdry : I am taking the liberty of including under the term morphometry , the counting of metameric parts , such as vertebrae and fin rays , as well as measurements of form and parts , such as depth , girth , head length , and location of fin insertions .
Perhaps the most serious difficulty in applying this technique to pelagic fishes is the sampling problem .
With members of the herring family ( Clupeidae ) , i t has been found that successive samples from the same locality differ significantly from each other with respect to a character under examination .
In some instances the reasons are apparent .
For instance , with the Alaska herring ( Rounsefel and Dahlgren , 19 3 2 ) , the Pacific pilchard ( Clark , 1947 ) , and the European sardine ( Navarro , 1948 , pp .
322 to 32 i ) , i t has been found that vertebral number differs significantly among the year-classes .
Where this occurs and where the fish are segregated into schools according to size , a sample from one school will be significantly different from those of another school if the latter is made up of predominantly different sizes and hence ages .
Other elements than year-classes and other characters than vertebrae may equally well cause significant differences between samples drawn from different schools of the same population .
With schooling fish , therefore , it is suggested that very serious attention be given to the design of sampling before investing the considerable time demanded by the counting or measuring of parts .
Many small samples are more likely to lead to sound conclusions than a few large ones .
However well the investigation may be designed , the study of races by the .
morphometric method has a more serious drawback .
If one gets negative results , i t does not necessarily prove Chat the population studied is homogeneous .
I t only means that characters studied are indistinguishable .
To me this defect seems especially serious for pelagic schooling fishes .
The individuals in such a population must conform with its companions in all its important activities .
T o a greater degree than in other populations individual variations , arising through mutation and affecting the individual 's abiIity to compete with its companions , probably , end to be lethal and to be eliminated immediately .
In other words , differences have little chance to arise and be perpetuated and studies based on finding differences are likely to yield negative results .
As an example of this , morphometric studies by Amemiya and Tamura ( 1943 ) have failed to reveal characters of the Japanese sardine that differ more from the California sardine than the differences found within the stocks on each side of the Pacific , even though there is no reason to believe that the stocks of pilchard or sardine in the two sides of the North Pacific intermingle .
I t is desirable , therefore , to apply other methods of research either in lieu or in verification of the morphometrical studies .
~ a r k u l ~ : Of the several methods of studying independence of fish stocks , the methods of marking or tagging have the .
advantage of affording direct evidence and also under favourable circumstances can yield other important information , including estimates of mortality and population size .
Unfortunately , practically all of our pelagic fishes are either difficult to mark or tag , or there are difficulties in recovering the tags , or both .
Some experiments conducted at our Fisheries Station at Woods Hole , Massachusetts , by R.
A. Nesbit and myself in 1932-33 are of interest in this connection .
Only a portion of the results of these experiments has been published , and it may be appropriate to give a brief summary here of some general conclusions we reached from marking and tagging various marine fishes by applying various marks and tags in various places on the fish and holding them in aquaria , live-cars , or in a large outdoor saltwater pool .
We found that initial mortality after placing the fish in enclosures , with or without tags , ranged from negligibility in sedentary fish like flounders ( Pleuronectidae ) to moderate in the case of active semi pelagic fish like the croakers ( Sciaenidae ) to extreme in the very active and truly pelagic fish like the mackerel ( Scombridae ) .
After the initial mortality extending through about two weeks there was no further severe mortality even from the rehandling of the fish for attaching tags .
Marking with a tatoo needle , using various pigments was unsatisfactory , some pigments reacted with sea water to become invisible , others soon faded out , and still others , though permanent , tended to become redistributed in the tissues , forming only blurred , unrecognizable blemishes .
External tags , however and wherever attached , caused some injury and the injury was progressive throughout the experiments .
The injury was least and progressed more slowly the more nearly the tag was attached to the part of the body with minimum motion .
Attachment on the tail or caudal peduncle was the least desirable place , on or near the immobile parts of the head the most desirable .
We presently became convinced that even the best externally attached tags had only limited usefulness and eventually either would migrate through tissues and drop off or would cause the death of the fish in the matter of some months when used on active fish .
As this became clear .
Mr. Kesbit conceived an idea that seemed to him so fantastic that he did not divulge it .
even to me .
He fashioned some strips of flat celluloid about 114 inch wide by 314 inch , long .
One evening when no one was around , he fished some scup ( Sparidae ) out of an aquarium ; with a scalpel he made a 1 / 4 inch incision in the belly wall , and with forceps pushed one of his celfuloid strips through the incision into the coelomic cavity of each fish and returned it to the aquarium .
He was.agreeably surprised to note that there was little bleeding and the tonus of the belly wall musculature closed the incision .
He was even more surprised to find on return the rlext mor rhg that all.of the fish were not only alive , but seemed none the worse for the treatrnent-and so they remained until the aquaria were shut down a t - the end of th = season .
From this , Mr. Nesbit went on to experiment with internal tags for a number of more delicate species such as fingerling squeteague ( Sciaenidae ) , and I - ran a test on mackerel ( Nesbit , 193 3 ; Sette , in press ) .
We both found that incisions healed perfectly and no perceptible internal irritation or inflammation resulted .
Mortality and growth of the internally tagged fish did not differ from the controls .
The internal tag now appears to be the one tag that is permanent and harmless to the fish .
There are difficulties in securing returns from field experiments since the tags are not found until the fish are opened for cleaning and then the tags are often so covered with mesenteric tissues that they escape notice .
However , a certain amount of ingenuity may be employed in connection with securing returns .
Dahlgren ( 193 6 ) used the internal tag in the Alaska herring fisherv .
There the catch is fed into fish c , meal plants by the ton without any individual handling .
One.would consider this the most unfavourable situations in which to recover tags .
However , Dahlgren used nickle-plated steel tags arid by installing electromagnets in the meal chute , captured the tags out of the processed products .
This had certain disadvantages add he lateremployed an electronic tagdetector , which automatically searched the fish for tags as they passed along a chute going into the plant .
Other schemes may be employed in other situations .
Where fish are individually gutted and cleaned by hand in large or small numbers at many localities , and a small strip of plastic or metal would be overlooked , there is a number of possibilities for rendering the tag more conspicuous .
Regardlea of the detailed mechanics of tagging and recovering , when tagging is used to study the independence or inter-relations of widely ranging pelagic fish , there is the necessity of securing concerted and co-operative action by the people of a number of different countries or governments .
Organizations such as this Indo-Pacific Fisheries Council may be the instrument for accomplishing this .
Results of tagging experiments sometimes are dificult to interpret .
Some years ago I had a curious experience with the Atlantic mackerel .
I n 1925 , under the auspices of the North American Council on Fishery Investigations , the Governments of Canada and the United States embarked on a co-operative mackerel-tagging experiment , and it fell to my lot to supervise the United States ' part of the tagging experiments and to collate and interpret the results therefrom .
Some thousands of tagged fish were released along the Canadian and United States coasts , and s m e hundreds were re-captured .
But anomalously , the Canadian tagged fish were re-captured off both the Canadian and United States coasts , whereas the United States tagged fish ( with one exception ) were retaken off only the United States coast .
A number of hypotheses might be offered to explain this anomaly , but of all that were considered , none could be accepted , because either lack of evidence by which to test i t or of the existence of contrary evidence .
This confusing result , coupled with obvious harmful effects of the tag on the fish , led to the abandonment of the experiment after several seasons of tagging .
In the meantime , an intensive investigation of the United States fishery was going forward and among other things , it included the measuring of the lengths of mackerel in the landed catch .
As the data accumulated over the years and were studied in the form of curves of - frequency distributions , it gradually became apparent that groups of these curves had distinctive features which fdlowed a regular pattern of seasonal change .
O n the basis of ten seasons of daily records on size-composition and locality of catches it was possible to construct an hypothesis of migration that accounted for these facts .
In brief , the mackerel migrated in two contingents , a southern contingent approached the coast well to the south and then travelled northward but not far enough to reach waters off the Canadian coast , while a northern contingent approached the United States coast somewhat later , somewhat farther north , and continued on into the waters off Canada to spend the summer , returnieg again through waters eff the coast of the United States in the autumn .
Once having arrived at a solution of the problem through study of size-co'mposition , i t was easy to see why the tagging results of some ten years ago had seemed anomalous .
A review of the records showed that all but one lot of fish in the United States part of the experiment had been tagged at a time and place and were of a size-composition appropriate to identify the fish as members of the sollthern contingent .
As such they could not be expected to show up in the Canadian fishery .
The one exceptional lot was from a place , a t a time , and of a size-composition appropriate to contain a mixture of both northern and southern contingent mackerel .
This lot yielded the single Canadian return froma all the mackerel tagged off the United States coast .
Whether studies of the size-composition of pelagic fish ' generally would be a successful tech - nique is di6cult to judge .
Success in the instance just related depended mainly , I think , on the exist - , ence of fluctuations of year-class strength which produced the distinctive features of the frequency curves , i t depended on a fishery that well covered a substantial portion of the stocks during their periods of migration and it depended on a sampling system of a design and magnitude capable of submerging the effects of a size-selective schooling .
Not all of these elements are likely to be present in a given situation .
I t is probably a general truth , however , that any particular method of studying races and migrations is likely to be so indecisive as to require the employment of a second technique for purposes of verification .
I have dwelt perhaps over long on the study of races and migrations not only because of the indispensable necessity of knowing the limits of the population or groups of on which a fishery is based , but also because practically all other phases of research are likely to be confusing until the population relationships are clarified .
Also , this is a field in which there is need for international collaboration such as this CounciI is set up to provide .
Unfortunately , it has consumed so much time that the remainder of the research field must be touched only very lightly .
FLUCTUATIONS .
We must touch on fluctuations because of their prominence in pelagic fish populations .
Also , they are the most serious obstacle to the application of methods of studying the dynamics of fish populations .
They may have their basis in real changes in abundance in the stock of fish itself or only changed in the relative success with which the fish elude the fishermen .
The latter type I shall call fluctuations in availability .
To reduce the fluctuations to a form in which they can be studied , fishery biologists have adopted almost universally the rate of catching fish ; that is , the average quantity caught per unit time per unit gear operated .
This eliminates the effect of varying amounts of fishing and allows attention to be centred on the changes in the population or its availability .
It has the further advantage of not requiring full and complete records on all of the catch .
A sample only is necessary .
And the sample usually is comprised of a group of fishermen or fishing vessels consistently fishing a single type of gear in a certain area over the period of years under considera - tion and for which the records have been or can be obtained .
Where skippers of fishing vessels are accustomed to keeping log book records or can be persuaded to do so , these comprise the best data because they consist of records made at the time and have , or can be designed to have , the pertinent details of the vessel 's activities recorded .
There are various problems in choice of units and methods of computation which we have not time to discuss .
One very elaborate treatment on a pelagic fish has been reported by Silliman and Clark ( 194j ) and may serve as an example of the complications which arise .
The catching rate based on such records and computations have been explicitly or inferentially considered as proportional to the density of the fish in the area fished and have been commonly accepted as indices of abundance .
With pelagic fishes , however , I prefer to use the term rfapparent abundance `` since catch is not only in proportion to the density of the fish in the area but also to the availability of the fish in the area as a consequence of the type of gear used and the manner in which the fish are distributed within the area , the way the fishermen or their gear are distributed in the area , and the way the fish react to the fishing activity .
To digress a moment , i t obviously would be desirable to have some way of estimating abundance that would be free of the availability influence .
This would be particularly valuable in surveying new areas where there is as yet no fishing .
Some years ago I personally investigated the possibility of estimating abundance by searching for the schools of pilchard from aeroplanes off southern California .
This proved even less reliable than actual fishing , for good catches were made by the commercial fleet in areas where no sign of fish could be seen from the air .
Although this is explicable from the fact that the air scouting took place by day and the fishing by night , i t still proves that pelagic fish schools cannot always be reliably located from air .
For other fishes in other areas i t may well prove more successful .
For instance , an air scouting service for the pilchard fishing off Washington coast where fishing is done by day proved ' very helpful .
Its use for estimating abundance was not tested , however .
Also I have seen some excellent aerial photographs of tuna in Australian waters .
Another possibility , meriting trial , is the use of sonic gear to detect fish schools .
This has been employed for surveys of herring schools in Norway ( Sund , 1943 ) , using a sonic sounding machine .
Such machines can detect schools that are directly under the vessel .
More complex types sending out a sonic beam in a lateral direction would enable one ship to search a much broader area sonically .
With both air observation and sonic detection , there are problems of species identification which have not been solved .
Certainly the techniques have not yet reached the perfection required for estimating abundance reliably .
We hope that the program we are initiating in the mid Pacific may include some work in this field .
In the meantime , i t appears that principle reliance for our estimates must be placed on actual fishing .
These will be of ajparent abundance , not actual abundance .
How to distinguish one from the other is now one of the major problems in pelagic fishery research .
.
One type of fluctuation to which ' pelagic fishes usually are subject , is caused by fluctuations in yearclass strength .
This was ably demonstrated by Hjort and by Lea for the North Sea herring over 20 years ago ( Hjort , 1926 ) , and presumably is familiar to most of us .
Some mawnina seasons give rise to - many offspring , others to very few .
.
X successful brood or year-class when i t reaches commercial age , by its abundance will produce good fishing for a number of years , until mortality cuts down its numbers , when poor fishing ensues until another successful year-class comes along .
The nature of this penomenon marks i t as a fluctuation in real rather than apparent abundance and its existence is detected by the size or age composition of samples from the catch .
However , here again the sampling system is important , especially when the fishery de ~ ends on schooled fish .
as for instance in uurseseining .
Since the fish tend to school according to size and age , i t is necessary to take many samples well distributed over time and area to get representative sampling .
Many small samples are to be preferred to a few large ones .
Data from the latter are likely to be very confusing indeed .
Even with ideal sampling , the fluctuatiofis in availability may confuse the record and I believe that the solution of problems of availability now constitutes the foremost task with respect to pelagic fisheries .
I t is a field where progress has been very limited .
In a few instances , investigators have found correlations between fluctuation catch and conditions of sea and weather .
To mention some of them , Thompson ( 1917 ) , found a correlation ' between temperature and catches of albacore ( Thunms germo ) ofl southern California , and there are several instances wbere influx of certain species from the North Sea through the Kattegat and Skagerack toward the Baltic were found to be associated with corresponding extrusion into these areas of North Sea waters .
It appears to me that progress in this field depends on elaboration of suitable frames of reference .
Two such frames probably are needed .
One of these is a frame of reference in the time-space dimensions .
Without realizing it , we are prone to refer our observations to a topographical frame of reference .
We use shore line , bottom contour or latitude and longitude as landmarks or as pegs on which to hang our data .
These are significant to pelagic fish only to the extent that they influence the conditions of environment .
The pelagic fish , living in or near the surface waters , often at great distances from land , rob ably are delicately adjusted to oceanographic conditions which are less intimately related to the topography than they are to the interactions between sea and atmosphere .
We probably should relate the various observations on the fish to such things as currents , upwellings , thermoclines , convergences and divergences .
These , of course , are everchanging in time and space in contrast to topography , which is fixed .
For studying and for developing pelagic fisheries , there is need for well-developed oceanographic programs , which not only describe the prevailing conditions , but record their departures from the prevailing pattern .
Along with the oceanographic programs we need to discover the reaction patterns of the pelagic fish to provide a frame of reference by which we may Amemiya , Ikusaku , and Osamu Tamura , ( 1943 ) - On the alliedneas of the Japanese and the California sardine , a morphological and statistical study .

evaluate a set of oceanographic observations in terms of availability of the fish .
Methods of conducting studies in this field have yet to be devised .
To the extent that i t is feasible the experimental method of holding pelagic fish in captivity should be utilized .
But undoubtedly the main effort will have to be work at sea in very close conjunction with the oceanographic work .
Among the many questions to be answered are : Under what conditions are schools formed ?
What determines the size of the school and the size composition of the fish within the school ?
How frequently are schmls formed , disbanded , and reformed , and under what conditions ?
What determines the level at which the fish are to be found ?
Under what conditions are they fast - ' moving and elusive and under what conditions do they tend to 1 , oiter and to be easily caught ?
What determines their routes of travel ?
The availability problem will be solved , probably , by finding the answers to these questions , one by on :. As this is done , it will pave the way toward understanding the dynamics of pelagic fish populations .
I t should also greatly aid the practical fishing operations and relieve this activity of some of its vicissitudes .

PELAGIC FISHERIES by J. D. F. Hardenberg of the To give a symposium on the development the pelagic fisheries in the seas under auspices of the Indo-Pacific Fisheries Council is not an easy task , for the simple fact that almost everything has to be developed or in other words there are , according to me , almost no real pelagic fisheries in existence over here .
The bulk of the landed fish is taken in the close vicinity of the shores .
Sometimes , it is true , the fishermen make long voyages at sea but this is only to get near another shore , may it be mainland or an island or group of islands and in this case they often market not in their homeport but somewhere e !
se where the prices are higher .
In general i t can be said that fishing outside a distance of 50 nautical miles from the nearest point of the coastline is an exception .
The reason for this is obvious .
I t is not so much a scarcity of fish in the open sea as the fact that only a negligible part of the number of fishingcraft is motor-driven .
All or almost all yrahus , sampans , catarmarans , or whatever they may be called are sailing vessels , open sailing vessels , wherein the fish cannot be iced , cooled or refrigerated .
This means that , should the fish be brought fresh to the market , the vessel has to return to its base port every day .
I t means therefore that the boats cannot go very far , the more so as they are depmdent on the offshore and on-shore winds at night and day .
Only motor fishing vessels-mostly Chinese or European owned-stay out longer than twenty four hours as they can have ice in the hold .
But these vessels too do not venture very far outside the old wellknown coastal fishing grounds , as they ' can get a sufficient catch there so there is no nerd for them to take hazards to go out into new and unknown fishing grounds , which economically might .
be a failure .
I have said above that the indigenous fishing is a coastal fishery .
In a technical sense this certainly is true , so far as distance from the shore alone is concerned in the definition of the word coastal fisheries .
Should one consider the technique of fishing also , then the situation is not so clear ; Fishing traps certainly belong to the coastal fishing and the amopnt of the landings from these in the various markets may vary from almost nil to about 80 or 90 % in some cases .
Thus for instance the landings from fishing traps in the market of Batavia are about 207 ; from the total catch , whereas the famous djermals in the Rokan Mouth near Bagan Si Api Api in the Straits of Malacca land almost the whole of the catch from this area .
Nevertheless these djermals , which are nothing else but a kind of fishing trap , are found far out sea beyond sight of the mast , up to a distance of 40 nautical miles , and thus quite near the limit of the sailing vessels .
In a biological sense the fishery in the coastal belt certainly is not wholly a coastal fishery as many pelagic species are found within this zone of 50 nautical miles .
Moreover the coastal belt parallel with the shore varies in width .
Near Bagan the 40 mile limit certainly lies within the coastal waters , near other coasts where we find a steep slope this zone is certainly much
In general i t can be said that fishing outside a distance of 50 nautical miles from the nearest point of the coastline is an exception .
The reason for this is obvious .
I t is not so much a scarcity of fish in the open sea as the fact that only a negligible part of the number of fishingcraft is motor-driven .
All or almost all yrahus , sampans , catarmarans , or whatever they may be called are sailing vessels , open sailing vessels , wherein the fish cannot be iced , cooled or refrigerated .
This means that , should the fish be brought fresh to the market , the vessel has to return to its base port every day .
I t means therefore that the boats cannot go very far , the more so as they are depmdent on the offshore and on-shore winds at night and day .

PELAGIC FISHERIES by J. D. F. Hardenberg of the To give a symposium on the development the pelagic fisheries in the seas under auspices of the Indo-Pacific Fisheries Council is not an easy task , for the simple fact that almost everything has to be developed or in other words there are , according to me , almost no real pelagic fisheries in existence over here .
The bulk of the landed fish is taken in the close vicinity of the shores .
Sometimes , it is true , the fishermen make long voyages at sea but this is only to get near another shore , may it be mainland or an island or group of islands and in this case they often market not in their homeport but somewhere e !
se where the prices are higher .
In general i t can be said that fishing outside a distance of 50 nautical miles from the nearest point of the coastline is an exception .
The reason for this is obvious .
I t is not so much a scarcity of fish in the open sea as the fact that only a negligible part of the number of fishingcraft is motor-driven .
All or almost all yrahus , sampans , catarmarans , or whatever they may be called are sailing vessels , open sailing vessels , wherein the fish cannot be iced , cooled or refrigerated .
This means that , should the fish be brought fresh to the market , the vessel has to return to its base port every day .
I t means therefore that the boats cannot go very far , the more so as they are depmdent on the offshore and on-shore winds at night and day .
Only motor fishing vessels-mostly Chinese or European owned-stay out longer than twenty four hours as they can have ice in the hold .
But these vessels too do not venture very far outside the old wellknown coastal fishing grounds , as they ' can get a sufficient catch there so there is no nerd for them to take hazards to go out into new and unknown fishing grounds , which economically might .
be a failure .
I have said above that the indigenous fishing is a coastal fishery .
In a technical sense this certainly is true , so far as distance from the shore alone is concerned in the definition of the word coastal fisheries .
Should one consider the technique of fishing also , then the situation is not so clear ; Fishing traps certainly belong to the coastal fishing and the amopnt of the landings from these in the various markets may vary from almost nil to about 80 or 90 % in some cases .
Thus for instance the landings from fishing traps in the market of Batavia are about 207 ; from the total catch , whereas the famous djermals in the Rokan Mouth near Bagan Si Api Api in the Straits of Malacca land almost the whole of the catch from this area .
Nevertheless these djermals , which are nothing else but a kind of fishing trap , are found far out sea beyond sight of the mast , up to a distance of 40 nautical miles , and thus quite near the limit of the sailing vessels .
In a biological sense the fishery in the coastal belt certainly is not wholly a coastal fishery as many pelagic species are found within this zone of 50 nautical miles .
Moreover the coastal belt parallel with the shore varies in width .
Near Bagan the 40 mile limit certainly lies within the coastal waters , near other coasts where we find a steep slope this zone is certainly much narrower and is in some cases not more than a few miles wide .
Referring again to the situation at Batavia we come to the conclusion that somewhat less than 40 % of the total brought to land depends on species with a pelagic biology .
The remaining 4021 from the landings at Batavia not yet accounted for are derived by far the greater part from species living within the coastal belt of the sea and are taken with different methods and are therefore not of interest to us within the scope of this paper .
The number of species on which a pelagic fishery depends is small , especially for our tropical waters , when compared with the fauna belonging to the coastal fauna from reef , muddy or sandy shores .
Our pelagic fish here , as everywhere else in the world , belong to a few families only , viz : Clupeids ( anchovies included ) , Carangids and Scombroids and some which are of lesser importancea t least up to this moment-as for instance flying fishes and dolphins and pomfrets .
Compared with seas from more temperate climates the iniportance of the above named groups is not the same .
Whereas over there Clupeids are of the greatest importance , they are of lesser value here , due , no doubt , to the smaller amount of plankton in our waters .
What we know about their habits in these waters is surprisingly little , especially about their distribution in space of the sea .
Near the coast of the shelf seas Clupea ( Harengula ) fimbriata and Clupea ( Narengula ) jerforata ( Cant .
) are certainly the most common and personally I have the impression that they are much rarer near shores bordering deep water .
However , one has to be very careful with conclusions in this respect , for most of the fishing is done thus far in our shelf seas and fishing methods are changing from place to place and as a result , the combination of species in the catch is also changing .
Species which are of importance to the pelagic fisheries , which have a true pelagic biology , therefore , are primarily Clupea ( Amblygaster ) leiogaster ( C.V .
) and Clupea ( Amblygaster ) sirm ( Riipj .
) .
Furthermore the mysterious Clupea ( Harengula ) longiceps C.V ., the so-called Oil Sardine , has some importance and i t would be desirable to know somewhat more of its habits .
This species appears a t certain years at certain places by the million , only to disappear almost entirely after a few months .
The species of the genus Stolephorus are of importance too and in a double sense , either directly as human food , or indirectly as a bait-fish .
Some species are strictly confined to the shore and live even in brackish water , others are confined to the salinity of open sea water and have the typical long slender forms of pelagic fish .
Here again it has to be said that we do not know very much about their distribution .
How far they venture out in the sea away from the coast is not known , though probably it will never be very far .
Of much more importance than the Clupeidsat least in the regions which I know best-are the Carangids .
But of the numerous species only two names need be mentioned , especially within the scope of this paper .
These are the species belonging to the genus Decapterus , and Caranx ( Selaroides ) lejtolepis .
About their distribution and biology something is known , here at least .
Decapterus species do n i t live in water with a salinity less than 32.5 % `` and i t is especially in the vicinity of the just-named isohaline that C. leptolepis lives .
A regular , but mostly unimportant bycatch consists of specimens belonging to Caranx ( Selar ) crumenophthalmus and sometimes Elagatis bipinnaulatus .
As I said , Decapterus live only in water with a salinity up to 32.5 % '' and probably these fish can be found everywhere in suitable water .
In the Java sea I have shown that the Decapterus swim to and fro in accordance with the changing salinities and that the stock of Decapterus consists of three components derived from a digerent source , parts af the South China Sea , the Indian Ocean and the FIores Sea , where the salinity is always higher than the required minimum to live in .
The bulk of the catch of Decapterus in Indonesian waters comes from the shelf seas-in this case primarily fmrn the Java Sea .
A rough estimate shows us that the landings from the Java Sea amount to 50,000 -60,000 tons a year .
The total catch of pelagic fish amounts to 80,000 -90,000 tons .
The difference of 30,000 tons in made up of Clupeids and Scomber species .
The genus Decapterus seems to occur everywhere in these seas , provided that the salinity is suitable .
The genus as such lives in the shelf seas as well as above deep water .
How far it venttifes out into the open ocean is unknown to me .
In literature five species of Decapterus are recognised for our waters .
I doubt whether this is true .
I t is possible that some recognised species in reality are only one and there are certainly other species not comprised in the number of five mentioned above .
I suspect even the existence of an Atlantic species over here but to discuss this is outside the scope of this paper and for various reasons it will not be an easy task to make my suppositions true .
However , several species do exist in our seas and at least one of them ( Decapterus Rurra ) seems to be confined to shelf seas and cdastal areas of deeper basins , whereas another one ( Decapterus macrosoma ) , with a much more slender body than the first , seems to be much more an inhabitant of the open sea .
There is one very striking fact in the biology of Decajtcrus as far as we know it .
Immature and young mature specimens live in higher waterlayers and seem to live in schools , and it is rn these specimens that the fishery depends .
Full-grown individuals are never found in the catches and are only occasionally taken out of deeper water by hook and line .
Of a growing importance for the development of the pelagic fisheries in our region are the Scombroids .
Of the genus Scomber several species are known .
One of these , Scomber neglectus v. Kampen , is entirely confined to the coast and seems to prefer a somewhat lower salinity .
Another one , Scomber Ranagurta Blkr .
lives in about the same conditions as the genus Decapterus and in fact the two are often captured together .
This species i5 often found in the water from the shelf seas , as well as above deeper waters .
Confined to the latter seem to be the other much bigger forms of Scomber .
I regret to say that nothing is known about their biology , or about the conditions of their distribution .
The Tunas and Bonitos are found above deep water or at the most at the edges of the shelf seas .
Only some of the smaller forms are exceptions to this rule .
In the Java Sea m e meets regularly schools of a dwarf tuna : Neotbunnus rarus Kishinouye and there are two dwarf bonitos , viz .
Auxis species and Euthynnus alletteratus afpnis ( Cantor ) .
Whereas Neothunnus rarus to my experience seems to be rare above deep waters ; the two others are found there more regularly , though always in close vicinity to the coast .
Larger forms of tunas as well as of bonitos prefer open water above great depths , though I have the impression that the skipjack or striped bonito ( Katsuwonus pelamis L. ) , is often found nearer to land than the true tunas , as for instance the yellow fin .
( Tbunnus neothunnus inacropterus ( Schlegel ) .
I t is little that we know about the distribution of the latter two .
They seem to avoid shelf seawater and seem to prefer long open stretches of ocean .
The striped bonito is found nearer inshore than the yellow fin .
How little we actually know about these truepelagic types is illustrated by the fact that I discovered Gymnosarda nuda ( Gunther ) in rather great numbers in the Molucca seas , a locality from which i t had not been described previously .
Cybium species are locally of some importance , as for instance at the south west coast of Borneo , where a special Cybium fishery is conducted for a few months of the year .
As a result of this short review we come .
to the conclusion that there are two groups of fishes with pelagic habits ; ( a ) small sized species which have their greatest density in the shelf sea areas and ( b ) large sized species which have their greatest density above deep seas .
As a consequence of this the pelagic fisheries , technically as well as economically , can also be divided into two .
Considering now the pelagic fisheries in the shelf seas from this area , the fisheries depend , therefore on Clupea species as well as on Decapterus , Caranx leptolepis and Scomber species and to a lesser degree on Stromateurs niger , we see that there is only one single method in use .
This method may vary in small technical details from place to place , but the biological essentials on which i t depends remain the same everywhere .
The fishermen here make use of the habit of all young Carangids to gather around or below some floating object .
It is well known for instance that young Caranx gather below jelly fish or below a piece of wood or a floating leaf or such .
The fishermen cunningly devise a lure to attract the fish and to concentrate them .
A rope is lowered into the sea with an anchormostly consisting of a few heavy stones only - to hold i t in place and with one or more bamboos at the upper end to act as a kind of buoy .
At regular distances a piece of coconut leaf is intertwisted in the rope .
These leaves act as a lure to passing schools of certain kinds of fish and they stay in the vicinity .
This lure is called by the Javanese fishermen a `` rumpon '' .
After a few days in the sea the rumpon is ripe for the fishing .
At day-break the prahu arrives at the rumpon and immediately the fishing begins .
A so-called pajang net , which is a kind of seine , with the upper line shorter than the lower , is rowed out around the rumpon in a semi circle .
At the outer ends of the net are two ropes , one of which remains on board while the other one is brought by a swimmer around the rumpon .
The prahu now takes position in such a way that the rumpon is in the middle between the open net and the boat .
The swimmer with the rope climbs on b ~ a r d and immediately the crew begins to haul in the net .
In the meantime , the small by-boat is set out and one man hauls in the rumpon carefully so as 6ot t o chase the fish away .
Soon the lower line of the net passes under the partly hauled up rumpon and then the rumpon is hauled up totally while the net is taken further on board .
The rumpon is lowered in position again now outside the net and is ready to attract new fish .
The biological features on which this method depends are interesting , but often very puzzling and much still remains to be found out .
Thousands of such rumpons lie scattered over the Java Sea and other parts of the Indo-Australian Archipelago .
Though mostly used in the rather shallow shelf seas , the rumpon is used too in deep water .
The rumpon is not hauled up there , but the net is dragged into the boat alongside the rumpon , which can be used until the rope has rotted away .
As there is always some current in the sea , we see the curious and hitherto unexplained fact that the fish always gather upstreams from the rumpon .
Fishery alongside the rumpon means , of course , that we are fishing only half of the accumulation of fish .
I t seems , however , that this loss is made good by the much greater catches made above the deep water .
In + ear water the catch is possible only a t daybreak , because only then the fish swim suficiently near the surface to be caught .
As the sun rises they sink deeper and deeper out of reach of the net .
As I have stated already all specimens of Decapterus are immature or just mature .
The Decap - ter & fisheries depend , therefore , on a special part of the life-cycle of the fish .
A t first sight it seems to be worth while to look to other methods to make i t possible to get hold of older fullgrown specimens .
Some other kind of gear , as for instance the Vignero-n Dahl trawl , should perhaps be used .
However , I do not think that any satisfactory results will be obtained .
Schools of Decapterus seem to be small , as is generally the case here in the tropics .
One should not forget that the task of the rumpon is to concentrate the fish at a given spot and to hold them there for some time .
Fishermen know quite well that a new `` rumpon '' takes several days to ripen ; or in other words , it will be a few days before schools , passing at random , when attracted by the lure will remain there and accumulate in sufficient quantity to make it worth while putting out the catching gear .
Two reflexes of the fish are to be taken into account here .
First there is a schooling reflex , possessed by many fish , whereby individuals assemble together and groups of individuals congregate into larger schools , and secondly the reflex or habit of staying and remaining in the vicnity of drifting objects .
The only way to develop this kind of fishery as far as I see , is to multiply the bumber of rumpons and this of course , especially in those parts of the sea where this technique is not used thus far .
I t is only in this way that I see a possibility of enlarging the total of the landings .
Every shallow sea or part of a sea within the area of the Council will get better or lesser results .
Only narrow channels with heavy tides should be excluded , for they are unsuitable for purely technical reasons .
While mecimens of Decabterus seem to lose the `` rumpon '' reflex , as we may call it , with maturitywhich manv other Caraneids do-this seems not to `` be the case with Caranx leptolepis and the same can be said of the Clupeids and the Scomber species and of the pomfrets , but on the other hand not of young Elagatis bipimnulatus .
In some local .
areas of the shelf sea a special fishery on Cybium by trolling is found .
Since this species is valuable , i t would be worth trying to find other localities where this fish is found in greater abundance than normal .
There is perhaps more than one species involved in this fishery .
As the fish is caught , with developed roe , during only a few months of the year , one may think of the suggestion that the fishery operates in spawning localities , to which the fish migrate during certain months of the year .
Knowledge on distribution in time and space is tdo scarce up till now , to say more on this subject .
The fishermen complain that sometimes the fish are plentiful but not biting , just as with the tunas .
Turning now to the deep waters , I wish to mention here first two curious methods of fishing on pelagic fish .
The fisheries on flvine fish .
as found in the , '' Macassar Strait , as far as I know are unique .
Small bamboo bownet shaped baskets are tied behind a drifting boat .
Pieces of seaweed are attached to the front of the baskets .
The female ' fish swim between these pieces , sets her eggs and by swimming further comes into the basket and is trapped .
This goes on day .
after day , while the fishing boat is drifting by wind arid current .
Though the method seems rather primitive the amount of fish landed by i t is rather great and may amount to 7,000 tons a year , as in 1947 , which was a very good year .
These and the preceding figures were collected by the Sea Fisheries Institute at Batavia .
Another interesting method of catching pelagic fish is what I should like to call the method of the drifting islands .
They are large bamboo rafts and are anchored in the amazing depth of 1000-1500 metres , with a rope of twisted rotan .
Pieces of coconut leaves are let down from the sides of the raft so that we have here a variation of the rumpon method of shallower seas .
The catches are the same as with the rumuon therefore .
chieflv Decauterus species , and further , the already mentioned C l u ~ e a nd Scomber .
But , moreover , in these waters schools of tuna or skipjack are attracted to the fish gathering around the rumpon and are caught by trolling .
The always difficult bait problem is solved here a t once by bringing the tuna to the bait and not the bait to the tuna and besides this the bait is used as a commercial catch too .
Of growing importance in our equatorial waters are the tuna fisheries of which the pre-war Japanese fishery people know more than we do now and I think that our knowledge of them in the Indian Ocean is even more scanty .
The tunas and bonitos are generally species living above deep water , small species like Neothunnus rarus ( Kishinouye ) , Euthynnus alletferatus ( Cantor ) and Auxis species excepted .
They can be found in shallow seas too , provided that the water is clear and has the required salinity .
Though the catch of these species is unimportant from a western standpoint , for the native population of our regions they are perhaps the most important .
In the first place the people can handle the smaller fish better than the larger ones and for the catch in great quantities the bigger more oceanic species need better gear , methods and boats than they have at their disposal nowadays .
Two forms of the bigger species , a tuna and a bonito , seem to be the most important .
These are Thnnus macropterus ( Schlegel ) and Euthynnus pelamys ( L ) .
The former is found in more open water than the latter which is frequently found near the coast and within the waters between island groups .
Personally-and I must lay stress on the word personally-I have the impression that the optimum density of both species is found along edges of currents , which of course is not so surprising as we will find there the greatest density of all other organisms too and as a consequence the best chance for the fish to get food .
The tunas and allied forms belong to one of the most difficult groups for the biologist and i t is only in the latter years that there is something , though still very little , known about their biology , as well as about their differentiation into races or special stocks in different parts of the ocean .
The differentiation into races is a wearisome task and takes up much time and can be done only by the specialist .
Investigations of the consistency of different races in the Indo-Australian Archipelago have begun , though it is much too early to say much about this .
I t seems that the relation between width and length , as has been found for instance in Australian waters , seems to hold good .
I t is a pity , however , that this relation is not visible at a single glance .
If this had been the case , then the minor fishery officials could give us valuable information abmt the occurrence of different groups to give us an insight into questions of migration , and migration there certainly is .
There is , however , a possibility that in the Skipjack one race can be recognised at once , even by the non biologist .
The root of the tail is normally blackish and I have found , in waters at the north of the Celebes , separate schools with whitish tailroots .
Some time later they disappeared out of the catches and according to the local fishermen they had migrated southward .
This difference in colour had certainly nothing to do with the stage of maturity as fish of both groups had the same stage of ripeness .
Where exactly yellowfin tuna and skipjack spawn exists is for the greater part still a mystery .
Recently Schaefer and Marr found some empty yellowfin and skipjack near the Marshall Islands .
I never saw skipjack thus far in xi ~ y part of the world , though local fishermen told me that the Japanese had them once or twice and they told me % too that an occasional young skipjack of the length of a hand is sometimes seen .
Empty yellowfin , however , were sporadically found .
This was contrary to expectation as skipjack is caught much more inshore than the yellowfin in several instances and one should expect , therefore , that the skipjack would spawn nearer to the coast , whereas the yellowfin is more oceanic .
This is clearly shown by the distribution of the two species .
The skipjack is found sometimes in great numbers in the inland seas , whereas the yellowfin becomes rarer and rarer the greater the distance from the open ocean .
Good catches of tuna and skipjack can be made in our tropical waters .
Comparison with regions like Japan and California is still rather difficuit , as equipment is by far not up to standard and the fishery op tuna is , as is the case with all other local fisheries , a one day operation so that the fishermen do not venture out far into the sea .
The difficulties and , as a consequence of this , the complaints of the fishermen are the same as everywhere else .
Sometimes schools bite , sometimes not , and i t is a belief among the fishermen in the Moluccas that non biting schuoIs occur more frequently at the time of the full moon than a t the new moon .
Several reasons for this peculiar behaviour may be put forwai-d , but none of them has in the ultimate been proved .
The bait problem is , as elsewhere , a difficulty too .
Yet I think that the opportunity to get bait in sufficient quantities is greater here than for instance along the coast of California and Mexico .
The great number of small bays , inlets , narrow channels between islands , with a great diversity of biological conditions , will give rise to the existence of schools of small fish , either cotisisting of small species or of immature specimens ~ f bigger species .
Shallow parts of the coast with patches of coral are to be specially mentioned in this respect .
A long open coast will in all probability give not so good a result .
since schools of small fish will be more dispers - ed and as a consequence the possibility for a good catch will be less .
A comprehensive study of charts will show the probable good shores for bait catches .
The method used over here to catch the schools is one differing from that used , for instance , on the California Coast .
The bait fishermen attract the fish with light , a method often used in other fisheries .
At some suitable spot one or more boats silently drift with a burning light over the stem .
Often two or three boats work toeether .
As soon `` as sufficient fish have accumulated the boats move gently and slowly to the shore , where another light is already burning .
When shorelight and boat lights have come together the boatlights are dimmed and put out and the fish remain now in the vicinity of the shorelight .
A shore-seine is brought now into a semicircle around the gathering fish from the shore and as soon as the encirclement is complete the fish are brought into one or more fine meshed sack-like nets where the fish remain until in the morning they are brought over into the fishing-boats .
When the catch is abundant the same performance is repeated .
One should perhaps expect the contrary and a double performance when the catch is poor , but this is not possible as in this case the whole act requires too much time , since the boats will wait a long time before making for the shore .
The difficulty with the above described method is of course the moon and this would prove doubly ' difficult should i t be true that the tunas will bite better a t full moon than at new moon .
When there are plenty of tuna bait is scarce and the vice versa .
The problem of eliminating the moonlight has not been solved thus far .
Bait consists of a diversity of species .
In those cases where I examined a sample anchovies were in the majority .
Next were young Clupea and Scomber and sometimes large quantities of young Caesio .
To my surprise I once saw a fairly good catch of Upeneus and a Tetrodon species .
I t seems that now and then the Japanese used fingerlings of Chanos chanos , the milkfish reared in ponds .
This should be at least something to help us at tihes when bait is scarce , but it is up to the economist to make a calculation whether i t is more profitable to let these fingerlings grow until they are marketable or not .
r \ very brief statement is givcn of thc work carried out and'ot the inajor conc1ur ; lons rcachcd in the investigation of oceanic , neritic and estuarine watcrs and of : estaurinc mud bottoms ot Austrdia .
DYNAMICS AND PRODUCTIVITY OF O C W I C W A T ' The dynamics and nutrient content of waters in the eastern Australian and south-western Australian slope and offshore current systems have been investigated by F. R. V. `` Warreen '' .
In the eastern Australian area in the period 1939-1942 F. R. V. `` Warreen '' made two complete and one halfcompieted oceanographical cruises along the eastern Australian coast from latitudes 28 `` S-41 '' S.
These cruises were worked during mid summer and midwinter oceanographical seasons .
Unfortunately , due mainly to wartlme conditions , 60 miles ofishore was the limit of F. R. V. `` Warreen 's '' section lines , and this proved to be insufficient to establish the hydrological features of the non c ~ rculating Tasman Sea waters for use as a norm of reference .
The following conclusions , however , can be drawn from the eastern Australian oceanic data : The whole of the eastern Australian area invcstigatecl is dominated by tropical-subtropical water masses circulated in a northsouth meridional line by the eastern Australian current system .
The summer-winter cycle of onshore water properties appears to be a function of the relative strength and hence offshore position of the eastern Australian system .
During the winter months a persistent northward counter current movement of Bass Strait waters into the vicinity of latitude 35 `` s occurs .
A t its northern limit a cIockwise eddy system with a diameter of about 30 miles is developed and governs the hydrological features of this area .
During the summer months an onshore counter-current is sometimes developed between Port Stephens and Sydney and carries high temperature waters from the offshore eastern Australian current into the region north of about latitude 32 '' s.
This movement combined with lateral intrusions discussed in conclusion ( Y ) develops alternate pockets of high and low temperature waters in this region during the summer months .
( 5 ) During summer months the development of vertical stratification in the shelf waters facilitates lateral intrusion of 200-300 m. water masses from the slope current into the bottom onshore region .
In certain areas , notably Trial Bay at latitude 3O030 'S and Port Stephens at latitude 32 % OtS , this intrusion comes to the surface and upwelling occurs , which has a marked effect on mean temperature .
The stations outside this upwelling area , at 3 1 `` 30 ' S , 37 ' 20 ' S , 41 '' 20 'S , and 42 `` 30 'S , have surface mean temperature lying on a straight line , the meridional decretement of which is probably a latitudinal heat loss from thc same southward flowing water mass .
Departures of several degrees from this normal latitudinal trend are evident in the upwelling areas .
( 6 ) Although nutrient depletion in surface waters is common in parts of the eastern Australian area , the overall availability of nutrients appears to be fairly high in Tasmanian waters , corresponding to an average English Channel condition ( Table I. ) .
In south-western Australia F. R. V. '' Warreen `` has made several oceanographica1 cruises in the course of her fisheries cxploratory work .
I t has been difficult to arrange for a seasonal cover of the area under these circumstances and the only section line worked regularly has been one extending 100 miles west of Rottnest Island at latitude 32 '' s. From this Rottnest data the following conclusions can be drawn to date :( 1 ) The current systems are relatively weakly developed and rather diffuse in their ' boundaries .

DYNAMICS AND PRODUCTIVITY OF O C W I C W A T ' The dynamics and nutrient content of waters in the eastern Australian and south-western Australian slope and offshore current systems have been investigated by F. R. V. `` Warreen '' .
In the eastern Australian area in the period 1939-1942 F. R. V. `` Warreen '' made two complete and one halfcompieted oceanographical cruises along the eastern Australian coast from latitudes 28 `` S-41 '' S.
These cruises were worked during mid summer and midwinter oceanographical seasons .
Unfortunately , due mainly to wartlme conditions , 60 miles ofishore was the limit of F. R. V. `` Warreen 's '' section lines , and this proved to be insufficient to establish the hydrological features of the non c ~ rculating Tasman Sea waters for use as a norm of reference .
The following conclusions , however , can be drawn from the eastern Australian oceanic data : - The whole of the eastern Australian area invcstigatecl is dominated by tropical-subtropical water masses circulated in a northsouth meridional line by the eastern Australian current system .
The summer-winter cycle of onshore water properties appears to be a function of the relative strength and hence offshore position of the eastern Australian system .
During the winter months a persistent northward counter current movement of Bass Strait waters into the vicinity of latitude 35 `` s occurs .
A t its northern limit a cIockwise eddy system with a diameter of about 30 miles is developed and governs the hydrological features of this area .
During the summer months an onshore counter-current is sometimes developed between Port Stephens and Sydney and carries high temperature waters from the offshore eastern Australian current into the region north of about latitude 32 '' s.
This movement combined with lateral intrusions discussed in conclusion ( Y ) develops alternate pockets of high and low temperature waters in this region during the summer months .
( 5 ) During summer months the development of vertical stratification in the shelf waters facilitates lateral intrusion of 200-300 m. water masses from the slope current into the bottom onshore region .
In certain areas , notably Trial Bay at latitude 3O030 'S and Port Stephens at latitude 32 % OtS , this intrusion comes to the surface and upwelling occurs , which has a marked effect on mean temperature .
The stations outside this upwelling area , at 3 1 `` 30 ' S , 37 ' 20 ' S , 41 '' 20 'S , and 42 `` 30 'S , have surface mean temperature lying on a straight line , the meridional decretement of which is probably a latitudinal heat loss from thc same southward flowing water mass .
Departures of several degrees from this normal latitudinal trend are evident in the upwelling areas .
( 6 ) Although nutrient depletion in surface waters is common in parts of the eastern Australian area , the overall availability of nutrients appears to be fairly high in Tasmanian waters , corresponding to an average English Channel condition ( Table I. ) .
In south-western Australia F. R. V. '' Warreen `` has made several oceanographica1 cruises in the course of her fisheries cxploratory work .
I t has been difficult to arrange for a seasonal cover of the area under these circumstances and the only section line worked regularly has been one extending 100 miles west of Rottnest Island at latitude 32 '' s. From this Rottnest data the following conclusions can be drawn to date :( 1 ) The current systems are relatively weakly developed and rather diffuse in their ' boundaries .
This leads to the development of a currentstirred , upper homogeneous water mass shal - * 11I !

( 51 1 lower than in the eastern Australian system .
The physiography of the onshore region with its offshore reefs and rather steep continental slopes does not favour lateral intrusion of the eastern Australian type .
The lack of subsurface intrusion leads to a nutrient isolation of the onshore water and their general impoverishment .
The lack of dep ; h in the current-stirred layer of the oceanic waters leads to their rapid nutrient depletion during the vernal-summer plankton production peak .
The diffuse and weakly developed current system leads to the development of isolated cells of high nutrient content surface waters , probably derived from an intense plankton production cycle in situ , There is some evidence to suggest that deeper waters in this region contain greater nutrient reserves than waters from the same latitude in eastern Australia .
This is probably an effect of the shallower dynamical mixing in the former area .
Surface temperatures appear to be Iess in the summer but greater if anything in the winter months than for waters in the same latitude on the eastern Australian coast .
PRODUCTIVIW CYCLES OF NERITIC SHELF WATERS Since 1942 , a weekly to monthly sampling of the neritic waters along the 35 fathom contour has been carried out a t various stations along the eastern Australian coast .
The area most persistently worked has been that between Sydney and Eden , with less information from Tasmania and only recent data from waters of northern New South Wales .
Fig. 1 gives the location of the principal sampling points .
In the area between Port Stephens at latitude 3Z040 `` S and Maria Island at latitude 42'40 's certain long-term cycles of hydrological conditions appear to be emerging .
There has been in the period 1943-1950 , in the Sydney area , a persistent rise in the annual mean column content of inorganic phosphates .
For the areas north and south of Sydney such data as are available display a similar trend ( fig .
2 ) .
This rise in phosphates has been accompanied by a similar increase in the annual mean surface temperature , with similar or declining bottom temperature during the same period .
At the Jibbon station at latitude 34 '' f 'S there has been a persistent and rapid rise in the mean total phosphate content of the water during the period 1942-1949 ( fig .
3 ) .
The relative ratio of organic F i 1 .
Map showing the location of the onshore sampling station referred to in the text .
to inorganic fractions within this total phosphate figure has varied almost inversely during the same period , and this is especially true of the bottom waters ( fig .
4 ) .
I t is apparent therefore that the increase in total phosphates has been brought about largely by an increase in the inorganic phosphate content of the water masses at this station .
A t the entrance to ' Port Hacking during the same period the mean sea level has been persistently dropping ( fig .
5 ) .
This mean sea level figure has been corrected for the effect of local barometric fluctuation .
The undoubted occurrence of lateral intrusions of nutrient-rich , deep offshore waters into the bottom layers at this station ( fig .
6 ) , together with the indications of persistent changes in the dynamics of the eastern Australian current system as indicated by the mean sea level variation , support a theory of abnormally persistent lateral movement as the ultimate cause of this phosphate enrichment .
In the south-western Australian coastal waters such data as are available since 1944 enable the following conclusions to be drawn : - ( 1 ) The average content of nutrients is very low , with almost continuous summer exhaustion ( table 3 ) .

No bottom reserves of nutrients are found , presumably because of the low turnover and lack of vertical stability .
High chlorinities and temperatures of these onshore waters during the summer months are developed as a result of local evaporation and insolation , which processes are rendered more effective by the isolation of the onshore shelf waters from the deep oceanic waters .
ESTUARINE HYDROLOGY Since 1940 in local waters , and later in other New South Wales , Tasmanian and south-western Australian waters , a study of the hydrological features of Australian estuarine system has been carried out .
Details of this xudy wiil appear shortly in a separate paper ; the following summary is presented here : - ( I ) I t has been found that whilst estuarine systems vary greatly in their structural features in general they are made up of the following four zones : ( a ) Marim zone-properties similar to those of the adjoining neritic waters .
Annual cycle of nutrients , with pronounced spring and autumn peaks .
Botrom deposits largely composed of sand overlying black mud .
Comparatively deep water with little or no tidal flats or shallow embayments .
Nutiient content of bottom deposits comparatively poor .
( b ) Tidal zone-properties resembling those of marine zone in respect of nutrient cycles .
Bottom deposits , however , especially in extensive tidal flats and shallow bays , largely dominated by black , viscid flocculent mud .
Nutrient content of these muds particularly high .
- ( c ) Gradient zone-this zone , which occupies the transition area between tidal and freshwater zones , exhibits the maximum degree of diurnal and seasonal variation in hydrological properties .
Within this zone there is a variation in chlorinity from almost marine to freshwater values .
The water mass of the zone is moved back and forth by tidal forces ; as a result of this oscillation there is a cyclical variation of hydrological properties at any fixed reference point within the zone .
The bottom deposits of this zone are composed of grey-black low organic .
muds .
The nutrient contznt is low and generally so also is the oxygen content , .
due probably to a persistent organic demand , ( d ) Freshwater zone-the properties of this zone are dependent upon local soil , climatological and , in respect of temperature , altitude conditions .
Its upper boundary has been arbitrarily defined as the limit of persistent annual flow .
Bottom deposits of this zone are largely composed of coarse sand and larger particles up to small boulder dimensions .
The nutrient content is poor .
The phosphate content of the waters of such an estuarine system generally varies from a maximum in the marine to a minimum in the freshwater .
In some systems rather considerable contributions of soil phosphates are found during the runoff cycle .
In general , however , soil cofitriblition of phosphates is fairiy poor .
In ihe bottom deposits tht content of readily available adsorbed phosphates is found as a maximum in the tidal gradient zone .
I t is felt that these differing distributions of phosphates lead to or are a result of a higher degree of water productivity in marine dominated systems , and a higher degree of mud productivity in tidal-gradient zone dominated systems .
The fact that marine dominated systems are excellent spatting grounds and the tidal-gradient zone systems arc more suitable for adult oyster fattening is felt to be bound up with these differences in substrate productivity .
( 3 ) The importance of tidal-generated diurnal conflicts of hydrological conditions in the ecology of estuarine systems has been asccrtained .
These conflicts vary from an extreme condition in which chlorinities and other propertics ranging from a marine to a freshwater value are encountered in a diurnal cycle , to others in which little or no variation is encountered in spite of big tidal rise and fall of water level .
In the atidal estuarine system of south-western Australia a diurnal conflict is rarely encountered except during flood cycles , and the role of tidal energy in the genesis of eastern Australian conflicts is demonstrated by analogy .
MUD METABOLIC AND ENRICHMENT STUDIES A small laboratory has been established at Shell Point on the George 's River .
Some work has been done on the chemical shanges in muds of the intertidal zone , and data an the hpdro !
ogical , meteorological and some microp3anktological conditions of this area , have been collected .
The effect of the addition of enrichment mixture on the chemical constitution and organic acti - vity of the mud in the upper 2 feet layer of the intertidal zone has been followed over a period of years .
A routine external measurement and internal examination of oyscers over treated and untreated flats has been carried out during the same period .
The interpretation of these growth data in respect of treated and untreated control flats has b e n difficult because of cross contamination of the mud substrate .
In order to overcome this difficulty an enrichment experiment in an adjoining marsh with sluice gate control of the volume of water entrapped , has been commenced .
Small scale tank experiments to test the effect of various fertilizer combinations on the water and mud chemical conditions have been carried on for some time .
Recently , preliminary steps have been taken to trace the coursr of from , the mud substrate to the growing oyster by means of radio-active phosphorus .
The micro-plankton of the water has been sampled by a pumping technique , using monel metal screens to filter off the plankton .
An ultracentrifuge is now available for quantitive sedimentation .
The relationships between air , water and mud temperatures during the winter months on an intertidal mud flat have been investigated by a number of fixed resistance thermometers with a portable balancing bridge circuit .
The development of cold water fronts with temperatures some 5 - 10 `` C. below the average temperature of the main water mass appears to be a common feature of this zone .

Phytoplankton studies on material collected by the research vessels of the Division of Fisheries of C.S.I.R.O .
show that indicator species are present which may be used for observing tropical , sub-tropical , sub-antarctic and estuarine influences .
From .
this , movement of currents , mixing of water , etc ., lnav be observed , although the data are too meaqre for any detailed discussion on the annual movement of water masses .
Enough preliminary work has been done to allow of such cliscuss ~ on of and when the necessary phytoplankton catches are made .
Important forms are tropical-Ornithoccrcus , Nistioneis , Ceratocorys , Chaetoceros coarctatus , Rhizosolenia Iatissima , ctc .; neritic-Dinophysis caudata , D. tripos , D. schroederi , Ceratinm trichoceros , Gondiodotna pdlyedricrtrn , etc .; sub-antarctic-Rhizosolenia hebetata , Chaetoceros criophilimn , Ceratiunl i ~ iterrnecliuzn .
Phytoplankton studies can be important for two reasons : All animal life is , in the first instance , dependent on plants assembling inorganic materials in organic form .
Thus , productivity in the sea depends on phytoplankton , since non planktonic algae are confined to the coastline and are rarely used as food by marine animals .
Certain indicator species can be readily detected in phytoplankton and these can be used to show whether a sample of seawater is derived from tropical , sub-tropical and arctic or sub-antarctic regions , or whether i t is a mixture of some of these .
There are limitations as to the depth at which phytoplankton grows , but , when we are dealing with surface waters , valuable information can be rapidly obtained .
In a study of phytoplankton as food , i.e ., productivity , quantitative methods are necessary .
This requires almost continuous sampling and the measurement of volumes sampled .
Unfortunately , plankton is not uniformly distributed in the sea and duplicate samples may give very different quantitative estimates .
In Britain there are two schools of thought regarding the best method of estimating plankton , one considering that a measuring net is the best means available , and the other favouring theoretical .
In either case , productivity can be pumps .
Both have serious drawbacks , practical and determined only from a large number of samples , and in addition , a great deal must be known about the area studied , so that the samples may be representative , e.g ., stations must be selected so that they will not be unduly influenced by local conditions ( river floods , etc. ) As a further instance , i t is desirable to choose stations in the neighbourhood of a convergence rather rhan a series of stations in a uniform body of water .
As our facilities do not enable us to take samples from far offshore or to cover the coastline of Austra !
ia at all adequately , we have not undertaken productivity studies apart from purely Iocal studies in estuaries .
Even these estuarine studies require a great deal of work to correlate them with fish production and hydrological data .
We have used both pump and net collection though , so far , have not used nets with meters .
We do intend , when conditions are more favourable as regards staff and vessels , to make our hauls as quantitative as possible , so that raw data , however meagre , may be available to future workers .
We have , therefore , been forced to confine our attention to the second function of phytoplankton investigation which is qualitative and roughly quantitative .
This gives us seasonal fluctuations , maxima and minima of species and an idea of their significance without giving any information on productivity .
A t our disposal at Cronulla are plankton samples , taken between 1939 and 19f0 from Port Hacking , with some gaps during the war period , a collection from cruises by F. R. V. ' `` Warreen '' from southern Tasmania to Queensfand between 193 8 and 1940 , and a little materia1 from Moreton Bay , Queensland , Northern Australia and New Guinea .
Unfortunately , there are few fine mesh net samples , so that the phytoplankton record has serious gaps .
Unfortunately not all the New Guinea plankton , and none of the Heard Island plankton have yet arrived at Cronulla , so this paper can only be an interim report .
The data available even on a , rapid analysis are capable of giving some useful results .
DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIES 1 .
Dinofla ~ eLEates .
Among the dinoflagellates , Dinojhysis may be regarded as estuarine and neritic .
* Bacteriologist , Division of Fisheries , C.S.I.R.O ., Australia .
A more northerly form , characteristic of Moreton Bay to Port Hacking is D. caudata , while D. tripos occurs as far south as Tasmania .
It overlaps D. caudata somewhat , being more prevalent at Port Hacking , less so in Middle Harbour .
Both forms are found in the `` Warreen '' lankt ton .
D. schroederi is frequent in Port Hacking and Sydney Harbour and transition forms between the three species are so common that I feel that they may all be varieties of the same species .
Kofoid ( 1 928 ) puts D. tripos ( = D. homunculus of Paulsen ) with D. caudata .
D. okamurai is a Port Hacking form and D , norvegica , D. hastrrta , etc ., are sub-tropical and probably neritic , extending into the estuaries .
D. miles has only been found in plankton from Lae , New Guinea , and is listed by Karsten ( 1905 ) as a tropical form .
It seems to be neritic .
Phalacroina hindmarchi is a southern form , while P. argus , P. doryphorum , P. rapn , P .
ovum and P , mitra seem to be northern forms .
Amphisolenia and Triposolenia have not been found .
A. globifera has been recorded by Hart .
( 1934 ) from `` Discovery '' plankton as a tropical form .
Goniodoma Polyedricum is a tropical form , occurring from New Guinea to latitude 39 `` s. and is recorded from tropical waters by Hart .
Pyrophacus horobgicum , regarded by Lebour as widely distributed , is regarded by Hart and myself as tropical .
So also is Podolampas bipes which also occurs in Port Hacking .
Noctihca scintillans is sub-tropical , Gymnodinium ( Pyrocystis ) lunula occurs as far south as 44 % , though Hart regards'it as tropical and subtropical .
G .
robusta and G , semicircularis have not been found south of latitude 30 '' s. Histioneis ( H .
hippoporoides ) has been found only once-off Montague Island .
Kofoid regards i t as essentially oceanic tropical , so its occurrence south of Sydney must ' be due to the presence of tropical waters .
Ornithocercus spp. have been found as far south as 43 `` s and , since all authors consider this genus as oceanic tropical-sub-tropical , they must indicate the presence of oceanic northern influence .
Hart considers Gonvarlaux polygramma as a sub-antarctic indicator , but this species has been identified as far north as Moreton Bay .
Since i t is dificult to identify , i t seems necessary to check my own identification .
Diplokalis has not been found south of Port Hacking , but as this is an estaurine form , this may be due to the paucity of estuarine samples from the more southerly stations .
Ceratocorys horridum is regarded by Karsten and myself as tropical , but has been found with other tropical forms to extend to latitude 43 '' s on one occasion ( August 1940 ) .
The naked forms except bor the Pyrocystis group are estuarine and so are Prorocentrum , Exuviaella and Protoceratium .
Oxytoxum has been rare in these samples .
Peridinium is a very widely spread genus , often neritic and estuarine .
Gran considers P. pellucidurn , P. ovaturn ., P. decipiens , P .
steinii , P , pentagonum and P. dcpressum to be boreal-oceanic , and Hart regards P. oceanicum and P , globulus as tropical .
I have found all these species except P , globulus abundant in Port Hacking , so they must be regarded as neritic or as cosmopolitan .
The same applies to P. cerasus , P. roseus , P .
claudicans and P. orbiculare .
Australia differs from Europe in that Ceratium is more frequently estuarine here than elsewhere .
Lebour ( 1925 ) cites C .
bjrzmdinclla as the only common fresh to brackish water species .
This species is rarely found in Australian waters , but C. furca , C. fusus , C .
pennatum , C .
extcnsum , C. macroceros , C. candelabrum ( tropical according to Hart ) and C. trijos occur often in brackish water a id are common in estuaries .
C. trichoceros is a common form in New Guinea and tropical and subtropical Australian waters .
I t is found in Port Hacking , suggesting tropical oceanic influence in this estuary , especially as it is associated with the oceanic diatom Planktoniclla sol which is frequent in Port Hacking .
Cerdium batavum , C. gravidum , C .
teres and C. bucephalum are tropical oceanic forms .
2 .
Diatoms .
Among the diatoms Chaetocrros criophilum and Rhizosolenia hebetata occur in Tasmanian waters and have not been found north of Twofold Bay .
They are associated with Ceratium intermedium , confirming the southern origin of the water .
Hart ( 1934 ) considers Ch .
criophilum to be restricted to antarctic and sub-antarctic waters and Ostenfeld ( 193 1 ) records Rhizosolenia hebetata as an arctic-bceanic type , though Hart does not record Phytoplankton studies on material collected by the research vessels of the Division of Fisheries of C.S.I.R.O .
show that indicator species are present which may be used for observing tropical , sub-tropical , sub-antarctic and estuarine influences .
From .
this , movement of currents , mixing of water , etc ., lnav be observed , although the data are too meaqre for any detailed discussion on the annual movement of water masses .

Goniodoma Polyedricum is a tropical form , occurring from New Guinea to latitude 39 `` s. and is recorded from tropical waters by Hart .
Pyrophacus horobgicum , regarded by Lebour as widely distributed , is regarded by Hart and myself as tropical .
So also is Podolampas bipes which also occurs in Port Hacking .
Noctihca scintillans is sub-tropical , Gymnodinium ( Pyrocystis ) lunula occurs as far south as 44 % , though Hart regards'it as tropical and subtropical .
G .
robusta and G , semicircularis have not been found south of latitude 30 '' s. Histioneis ( H .
hippoporoides ) has been found only once-off Montague Island .
Kofoid regards i t as essentially oceanic tropical , so its occurrence south of Sydney must ' be due to the presence of tropical waters .
Ornithocercus spp. have been found as far south as 43 `` s and , since all authors consider this genus as oceanic tropical-sub-tropical , they must indicate the presence of oceanic northern influence .
Hart considers Gonvarlaux polygramma as a sub-antarctic indicator , but this species has been identified as far north as Moreton Bay .
Since i t is dificult to identify , i t seems necessary to check my own identification .
Diplokalis has not been found south of Port Hacking , but as this is an estaurine form , this may be due to the paucity of estuarine samples from the more southerly stations .
Ceratocorys horridum is regarded by Karsten and myself as tropical , but has been found with other tropical forms to extend to latitude 43 '' s on one occasion ( August 1940 ) .
The naked forms except bor the Pyrocystis group are estuarine and so are Prorocentrum , Exuviaella and Protoceratium .
Oxytoxum has been rare in these samples .
Peridinium is a very widely spread genus , often neritic and estuarine .
Gran considers P. pellucidurn , P. ovaturn ., P. decipiens , P .
steinii , P , pentagonum and P. dcpressum to be boreal-oceanic , and Hart regards P. oceanicum and P , globulus as tropical .
I have found all these species except P , globulus abundant in Port Hacking , so they must be regarded as neritic or as cosmopolitan .
The same applies to P. cerasus , P. roseus , P .
claudicans and P. orbiculare .
Australia differs from Europe in that Ceratium is more frequently estuarine here than elsewhere .
Lebour ( 1925 ) cites C .
bjrzmdinclla as the only common fresh to brackish water species .
This species is rarely found in Australian waters , but C. furca , C. fusus , C .
pennatum , C .
extcnsum , C. macroceros , C. candelabrum ( tropical according to Hart ) and C. trijos occur often in brackish water a id are common in estuaries .
C. trichoceros is a common form in New Guinea and tropical and subtropical Australian waters .
I t is found in Port Hacking , suggesting tropical oceanic influence in this estuary , especially as it is associated with the oceanic diatom Planktoniclla sol which is frequent in Port Hacking .
Cerdium batavum , C. gravidum , C .
teres and C. bucephalum are tropical oceanic forms .
2 .
Diatoms .
Among the diatoms Chaetocrros criophilum and Rhizosolenia hebetata occur in Tasmanian waters and have not been found north of Twofold Bay .
They are associated with Ceratium intermedium , confirming the southern origin of the water .
Hart ( 1934 ) considers Ch .
criophilum to be restricted to antarctic and sub-antarctic waters and Ostenfeld ( 193 1 ) records Rhizosolenia hebetata as an arctic-bceanic type , though Hart does not record it .
Tropical forms occurring from New Guinea to Montague Island , and occasionally farther south arc Climacodium frauenfeldianum , Lauderia annulata , Rhizosolenia bergoni , R. latissinta , Chaetoccros pemrvianus , Hemiaulus haucki and Cb .
coarctahm .
These have the same ranee as the dinofla ~ ellates `` '' Ceratocorys horridum , Gonyaulazrx pacifica , Ornithocerczcs magnificcs , 0 .
quadrahs , Dinophysis schroederi , etc. Ste.phanopyxis palmeriana , S , turris , Sfreptotheca thamensis , Schroederella delicatula , Rhizosolenia calcar-avis .
etc ..
occur from New Guinea to Twofold Bay , and in certain seasons ( notably August , 1940 ) south of this , as do Ornifhocertrs thurni , Dinophysjs rfludrta , D. trijos , etc ., among the dinoflagellates .
I t will be realised from this that n7e can distinguish sub-antarctic water , tropical oceanic water and neritic influence by the phytoplankton .
In these collections , as in those of `` Discovery '' recorded by Har t and Hardy , the diatoms are the most important part of the phytoplankton from a productivity standpoint , although in New Guinea waters the blue-greens Oscillatoria , Lyngbya and Trichodesrnizm outnumber the diatoms in many of the sainples .
~ m o n ~ the blue-greens the pra'sitic Ricbelia is usually found on species of Rhizosole ~ fia from tropical waters .
SOME RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OCEANIC AND ESTUARINE FLORAS One important feature of Australian phytoplankton is the occurrence in certain estuaries of forms usually regarded as oceanic .
In Port Hacking , for example , Ornithocercz ~ s magnif cats and 0 .
quadratus have been found on two occasions .
These are probably due to the influx of oceanic water from the east Australian current , but the common occurrence of such species as Ceratium trichoceros and Chaetoceros coa ; ctatunt suggests a more permanent state .
This is confirmed bv tlie freauent occurrence and apparent multiplication in Gunnamatta Bay of Planktoniella sol ( generally regarded as truly oceanic ) , Stephanopyxis , Schrocderella dclicatula , Strejtotheca , Rhizosolenia robusta and Chaetoceros species .
These estuaries are drowned valleys with a deep floor ( up to 90 metres ) and a shallow entrance ( 12 metres or less ) .
I consider that there is therefore stratification within the euphotic zone , so that the phytoplankton in the lower layer is constant in its oceanic neritic character while the upper tidal layer has a neritic flora with estuarine elements , mixing occurring between lower and upper layers in sunny weather .
The presence of non estuarine forms is too frequent and too ~ rofuse-often more so than outside-for these forms to be continually brought in with the tide .
Unless they were able to escape freshets they would be killed off and revlaced bv an estuarine flora which does predominate at times , e.g ., the almost pure Gonyaulaux flora of Middle Harbour at the present time .
' `` RELATIONS BETWEEN ESTUARINE PHYTOPLANKTON AND THE F'LORA OF ESTUARINE MUDS A curious feature of the plankton in the tidal water flowing over the mud flats in Botany Bay and Port Hacking is that i t is largely neritic in character , while the mud flora consist largely of sessile forms .
There is little exchange between the two .
The muds contain pennate diatoms with some Cosciuodisct ~ s species while these forms ( except for the ubiquitous Nitzschia seriatn , N , rlosterinnt , Climarosjbenia and a few other forms ) are rare in the water .
Yet glass plates suspended in the water at various depths become covered with pennate diatoms in a few days at certain times of the year .
I t would seem that the sessile pennate forms are stimulated to rapid reproduction by the presence of a surface possibly related to the adsorption of nutrient salts on the surface .
There is confirmation of this in some laboratory experiments carried out at Cronulla .
SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS There appear to be two main diatom maxima along the whole east coast of Australia , one in September-October and the other in May-June , with a minor peak in January-February .
There are dinoflagellate peaks in late December-January , sometimes January-February and October-early November .
The peaks of estuarine forms , e.g ., Gonyadaux spinifera appear to coincide with those of the neritic and oceanic forms .
At times the peaks consist of one species , e.g ., Ceratium furca , C. fuszts , Rbizosolenia robusta , but more frequently a number of species of the same genus are involved , e.g ., Ceratium triposmacroceros-trichoceros-ostenfeldi , and Chaetoceros spp. Sometimes several genera , e.g. Skeletonema , Stephanopyxis , PlanktonielEa , Ditylzcm , etc ., may be involved .
Often too , there is a series of peaks rather than a single maximum owing to conse6utive peaks of different forms .
At times , one finds ' pure or almost pure phytoplankton in the hauls followed a week or so later by hauls with no phytoplankton .
Has this been grazed off completely by the zooplankton ; if so , what does the zooplankton feed on ?
It must either be completely carnivorous or else be able to live for some time without grazing .
This phenomenon adds difIiculty to productivity studies on a coastline such as this where such changes from phytoplankton to zooplankton to mixed hauls and back again seem both frequent and sudden .
PHYTOPLANKTON AS AN INDICATOR OF WATER MOVEMENTS We have reached some interesting conclusions regarding water movemedts off the east Australian coast from evidence provided by the phytoplankton .
I t would appear that , broadly speaking , the tropical and , sub-tropical forms occur along the New South Wales coast from December to February .
At times , in the winter .
and spring , the tropical water lies - * April , 1950 , S 62 ) farther off the coast , its being taken by water containing a mixture of forms including estuarine and neritic species .
The tropical water may turn back to the coast near Montague Island or even further south , and strong tropical influence may reach the east coast of Tasmania as in August 1940 , when a number of tropical diatoms and , dinoflagellattes were collected there by F.R.V .
'' Warreen `` .
Southern , sub-antarctic forms are found a t times as far north as Twofold Bay .
These water movements are discussed in greater detail in a paper now in press .
Enough has been said to show that regular hauls for phytoplankton on the east Australian coast can give very useful information regarding water movements .
We now know the indicator species , and once we know the relation between water movements and pelagic fish occurrences we should be able to predict the movement of these fish from regular phytoplankton hauls .
Unfortunately , up to the present we have had too many gaps in the plankton record to allow of our plotting water movements or relating the seasons with phytoplankton occurrences .
I t is , perhaps , not easy to justify such an intensive plankton programme without a large pelagic fishery .
A t the same time , such a programme could help to economise effort in the actual fishery as soon as water movements could be interpreted in terms of fish production .

( 63 of what is often termed the `` population dynamics '' of the species .
Both in the Atlantic and Pacific , the tunas have been the ' objects of commercial fishing from the earliest times and , likewise , they have attracted the attention of marine biologists for hundreds of years .
Due to their large size and their pelagic , oceanic habitat , however , knowledge of their ways of life is very meagre , even in view of the hundreds of papers which have been written concerning them .
Except perhaps for the research conducted in certain parts of the Mediterranean Sea and adjacent regions of h e Atlantic Ocean , and some work on the West Coast of the United States , and in Australia , no intensive studies of tunas have been undertaken , except by Japanese scientists .
Japanese fishery scientists , who were very active in studying the tunas prior to the war , directed some attention to the study of the life history and racial distribution of the Pacific tunas , but their primary attention was directed towards elucidating the distribution and ecology of the several species for the purposc of expanding and developing the fishery for them .
Research into those aspects of the biology of the tunas which are essential to developing an understanding of the population dynamics of the stocks of those species , aod upon which any conservation , national or international , must be based , has been generally scanty everywhere .
There has , however , been notable recent progress in this field .
It is with this category of recent tuna research that this paper will be primarily concerned .
Although all sorts of knowledge about the tunas is of value to their wise utilization , certain aspects of their biology are of basic importance to fisheries development and management , such as the limits of independent populations , and the factors determining the abundance of fish in a population and fluctuations therein .
I t will be a long .
time before we have a complete understanding of these aspects of the biology of the tunas , but some fragments are beginning to emerge .
RACIAL STUDIES .
Of basic importance to the management of any fishery is a knowledge of the units-called `` races '' , or `` stocks '' , or `` populations '' - into which the species is separated .
Such a unit is composed of individuals , inhabiting a certain part of the sea , which freely intermix and interbreed with each other , and which intermix and interbreed with members of other units little or not at 311 .
These population units must be treated ns entities in any p !
an for det'eloping and managing a fishery .
A fishery , however intense , on one popuiation will have no effect on other , unfished populations of the same species .
Conversely , where a single population inhabits ' as large region , fishing in one part of the region has a direct and important effect on the population in every other part .
We thus perceive the importance of determining whether each species of Pacific tuna is separated into several separate populations or is composed of a single , vast , ocean-wide population .
The solution of this problem is being approached primarily by means of comparing measurements of body form of tunas from different areas of the Pacific .
Since it appears impractical - to have one person or one team of persons take similar measurements on specimens of one species of tuna from all the widely separated places where they occur , i t has been necessary to attempt to standardize thc measuring technique so that data gathered by different observers in different places may be comparable .
The basis of this standardization among Arnerican workers has been the list of dimensions and counts employed by Godsil and Byers ( 1944 ) in their systematic study of the California tunas .
Marr and Schaefer ( 1949 ) have redescribed these dimensions and counts , as well as several additional ones which may be useful , and have set forth methods of taking them .
It is hoped that these measurement methods will become fairly standard among workers elsewhere in the Pacific .
The analysis and comparison of measurement data on the body form of tunas is troublesome , even when the original data are all taken in a comparable fashion .
Since , as is well known , the ratio of the size of one body part to another changes with the size of the fish as it grows , such ratios cannot be compared directly without suitable correction for this ' factor .
Schaefer ( 1 9 4 8 ) in describing the relative growth of Central American yellowfin tuna ( Ncothunnus ?
nacroptcrzls ) and Schaefer and Walford ( 1950 ) in comparing body dimensions of yellowfin tuna ( Neothunnz ~ s ) from the Atlantic and Pacific , have based such correction on linear regressions between one dimension and another , or between such dimensions transformed according to some simple mathematical for ~ nula .
Godsil ( 1948 ) dealing with extensive data on Paclfic yellowfin tuna and albacore ( Thunnus germo ) has employed a simple carvilinear relationship between dimensions $ or the same purpose .
These procedures , while probably the best available , must yet be employed with caution , because they cannot complete !
^ correct the data for size-connected variations which may then be confused with true population differences .
This difficulty arises from the fact that the regression equations employed represent straight lines or simple curves which can be at best but good approximations to the complex true relationship between the variables .
Thus it may be , in comparing body dimensions of saillples of differing size composition , especially where ldrge samp !
es make detection of small differences possible , that even with a correction for variation of dimension wlth fish size , there mill be found differences due to the residual difference between the equation chosen to represent the relation between variables and the true ( unknown ) relationship , in addition to the real difference between populations which we are trying to measure .
Thus , for example , Godsil ( 1948 ) has found differences between repeated samples from the same region ( and presumably the same population ) greater than those attributable to chance .
He has explained this on the basis of a presumed difference between schools due to lack of con ~ plete mixing between schools of different history in early development , but this seems to us unlikely .
Whatever the cause , however , biological or merely procedural , the phenomenon is real and must be dealt with .
The means of doing so will not be gone into in detail here ; in essence it will consist either of employing as a standard the observed variation between repeated samples from a locality , or of selecting samples for comparison so that they are of nearly equivalent size composition , with the latter being perhaps somewhat preferable theoretically .
The work of Godsil ( 1948 ) has indicated that both the yellowfin and albacore tuna of the American West Coast are probably racially distinct from those of Hawaii and from those of the western side of the Pacific .
His samples from other than the American West Coast were , however , very small and further verification is indicated .
The author is presently ' engaged in analysis of fairly extensive data on Hawaiian yellowfin tuna to compare with those from the American West Coast and elsewhere .
We have for comparison also a small sample from the Society Islands , a few sets of measurements from Japan , and a few from the Phoenix and Line Islands .
From the latter places more specimens are currently being collected by POFI research vessels .
Our analyses have not , as this is written , progressed far enough to permit even tentative conclusions to be drawn .
In addition to these data on yellowfin tuna , we have collected and commenced analysis of sizeable samples of Hawaiian skipjack ( Katsuwonus pelamis ) and big-eyed tuna ( Parathnmms sibi ) to serve as a basis of comparison with measurements of specimens from other parts of the Pacific .
We shall , as these studies progress , begin to obtain an idea of the population divisions of the Pacific tunas .
AGE AND .
GROWTH .
The population dynamics of a fish stock are intimately connected with the age and rate of growth of its members .
A population of a slow-growing , long-lived species is less subject to fluctuations in abundance due to variations in size of entering year classes than is a population of a fast-growing , shortlived species .
Where the population is composed of many age groups which go through life slowly , failure or super-abundance of a single age group has small effect on the total stock of fish .
Where the population is composed of but a few age groups , variations in abundance of one of them has a relatively large effect on the total stock .
Studies of the age and g o w t h of Pacific tunas have been very meagre .
Kishinouye ( 1923 ) believed that `` The growth of tunnies seems to be very rapid '' , and that Thnnus orientalis , T. germo , and N : macropdews reached a meter in l e n g c a n d about 11 kilos in weight in two years .
Aikawa and Kat6 ( 1938 ) , however , deduced a rather slower growth from their studies of age based on rings on the vertebrae which they - took , albeit without much apparent justification , to be annual markings .
Brock ( 1944 ) concluded from studies of length-frequency data on albacore landings that `` only a few year classes are present * in the temperate water fisheries for this species , and that these , are immature '' .
I have previously published ( Schaefer 1948 ) some rather scanty length frequency data for N. macropterw taken off Costa Rica , from which i t appears that in the spring months there is a distinct mode near 60 cm , and another near 81 cm .
which were believed to be most probably composed of one year old and two year old fish , respectively .
Sampling of tuna catches to determine size composition of the populations which they represent is peculiarly difficult because , like some other pelagic fish , they tend to.schoo1 by size .
I t is important , therefore , to sample many schools , rather than merely to measure many fish , if the sum of the samples is to be representative of the whole population .
We were very fortunate to discover shortly after we began our tuna studies in the Hawaiian area that the local flag-line fishery and the system of marketing the fish caught by i t provided almost ideal ready-made size frequency data for the yellowfin and the big-eyed tuna ( Paratbunnus sibi ) of the large sizes which that fishiry pursues .
The fishery is conducted by means of set lines which are fished twenty to thirty fathoms below the surface and catch large yellowfin and big-eyed tunas , marlin , swordfish , and a few albacore .
Each line captures only a few fish each day , so that in the aggregate the catch of the fishery samples rather widely the tuna population present at the depths fished .
The fish are sold at auction , one fish a t a time , and the auction market which handles about 80 % of the landings at Honolulu has kept for the past two MARCH APRIL MAY JULY A W U s 1 SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER Figure Monthly pcrcencage size frequency distributions of flagline landings of yel1owfin tuna at Honolulu , and deviations of monthly distributions from the year 's average , for the year 1948 .

years records of the species and weight of each fish handled .
Thus we have available weight-frequencies for each month consisting of large , well distributed samples of the tuna population available to the Iongline fishery .
Mr. Harvey Moore of the POFI staA is engaged in the detailed analysis of these data , which he has assembled from the records of the market in question .
The figures presented here were prepared by him as part of a detailed study which will be completed and published later this year .
In figures I and 2 are plotted the frequency distribution by sizes of each month 's catch of yellowfin tuna , on a percentage basis , with the average curve for the year superimposed on it .
Positive deviations of the month 's curve from the average are shaded to make the modes easily followed .
I t is easily seen that a group of fish appears in the fishery in December and January a t a weight of 70 or 80 pounds and can be followed through month by month until by the time they are a year older the modal weight is in the neighbourhood of 130 pounds .
This mode is more clearly brought out in figure 3 where the yellowfin tuna data for both years are combined and plotted as deviations of the frequency curve for each month from the average of all data .
There can be no doubt that this mode represents an age group of fish growing in one year from an average weight of about 77 pounds ( at a length of 120 cm .
) to a weight of about 13 1 pounds ( at a length of 148 cm .
) .
The length scale at the bottom of these graphs represents the lengths in centimeters corresponding to the weights in pounds on the scale above according to the relationship log L = 1.45660 + 0.33290 log W obtained from a sample of 200 fish representing the range of sizes encountered in the Hawaiian region both in the flag-line and live bait fisheries .
These data confirm the previous conjecture that the yellowfin tuna are very rapid growing .
If the hypothesis , based on my previous Costa Rican data , is correct that this species at one year old is about 60 cm .
in length and at 2 years old is about 85 cm .
in length , and Hawaiian fish grow at about the same rate during these years , the fish of the age group making up the mode in question are probably either in their third year or fourth year of life .
I n any case , with respect to yellowfin tuna we seem quite safe in concluding at this stage of our research that ( I ) they are very rapidly growing fish , ( 2 ) the tuna that are taken in the live bait fishery ( fish up to 100 pounds in weight ) are very young fish , and ( 3 ) both the surface fishery by live bait for the very young tuna and the flag-line fishery for older fish are dependent at any one time on only a .
few age classes which make up the fishable stock .
Current studies , by Mr. Vernon Brock of the Territorial Division of Fish and Game , which I ho2e will see publication in the very near future , indicate that the skipjack are likewise young , fast growing tunas and that in Hawaiian waters two age classes constitute the bulk of the stock during a given fishing season .
The fact that a tuna stock is composed of only a few age groups has the important implication that if the recruitment fluctuates very widely the stock may also be expected to exhibit large fluctuations since there is lacking the '' buffer `` action of many other age classes to dampen out the effect of variations in recruitment .
This becomes more important economically to the fishery the more intense the fishing becomes , because a t high levels of fishing the catch cannot be greatly increased by simply stepping up the fishing effort in a poor season .
SPAWNING HABITS .
The likelihood of fluctuations in recruitment depends to a large degree on the spawning habits of the runas .
If a single population of tuna spawns over a wide area and a long season , fluctuations in environmental conditions are much less likely to give rise to large variations in survival and be reflected in the recruitment than if spawning takes place only on one spawning ground during a short season .
The spawning habits of the Pacific tunas have been quite obscure until very recently .
Yellowfin , skipjack and black skipjack ( Euthynnus lineatus ) as well as frigate mackerel ( Auxis thazard ) were found in 1947 to spawn during the early spring off Costa Rica and Panama ( Schaefer and Marr 1948a , 194833 ) .
Marr ( 1948 ) also demonstrated that both the yellowfin and skipjack spawn in the region of the Marshall Islands during the summer .
As I noted in another paper ( Schaefer 1948 ) there are references by several authors to evidence of tuna spawning near Japan , Hawaii , Palau , and the Solomon Islands .
Juvenile specimens of E. yaito and Awxis sp. were noted also from material coIlected by A. W. Herre at Celebes .
Papers by De Jong ( 1940 ) , Delsman ( 193 1 ) , and Delsman and Hardenburg ( 1934 ) describe eggs and larvae of Euthynms alleteratus , Neothunnus rarus , and Thz ~ nnus tbzinnina from the Java Sea .
Papers in Japanese , recently translated by POFI translators , such as Kishinouye ( 1919 ) and Hatai et a1 ( 1941 ) give evidence of several species of tuna spawning both in the waters adjacent to Japan and in the waters in the region of the Pacific Trust Territories ( f o m r Japanese Mandated Islands ) .
Juvenile skipjack captured near the Hawaiian Islands have recently been described by Eckles ( 1949 ) .
Other , smaller specimens of this species have since been captured by scientists of the Territory of Hawaii Division of Fish and Game .
Occurrence of females of K. pelamis , N. macropterus and P. sibi in advanced stages of maturity in Hawaiian waters during the spring and summer months , and the collection last year of a running ripe female K. pelamis and a very nearly running ripe female N. marropter ~ ~ s from these waters by scientists of our staff prove conclusively that these species spawn in these waters , and i t seems likely from the evidence of gonad examinations that the spawning season of each is fa i r ly extended here .
Wade ( 1 949 ) has recently described juvenile Allxis from philippine waters , and has advised us in personal communications of the capture by tow nets of about 2000 specimens of larval stages of various tunas and tuna-like fishes .
It begins to appear that the Pacific tunas spawn in many parts of the Pacific , indeed it seems they may spawn throughout much of their range .
The next step is to find out how extensive in time and space is the spawning in a single rcgion .
This we are undertaking to do in the region of the Hawaiian Islands by means of systematic .
study of gonads of females in the commercial catch and by tow net collection of eggs and larvae .
During the spawning season this spring and summer we shall attempt to find out about the vertical distribution and the rate of development of the eggs and larvae .
If this attempt is successful we shall then be in a position to conduct quantitative spawning surveys by means of tow net sampling in subsequent years .
Compared to our knowledge of many of the commercially important species of the northern seas , the halibut , cod , plaice , salmon , herring , haddock , etc ., our store of knowledge of the Pacific tunas as indeed pitifully small .
The efforts that have recently been expended towards rectifying this have , however , met with at least initial success .
The cooperative efforts to fishery scientists throughout the Pacific promise to provide an early solution to many of the mysteries of long standing regarding the basic biology of the Pacific tunas .

BACTERIA IN MARINE ENVIRONMENTS E. j. Ferguson Wood * ABSTRACT The marn difficulty of marine bacterioIo is to explain the way in which thc smaU number fbacteria which can be cletccted in the open sea brings about the transformations usually ascribed to it .
Even in muds this difficulty occurs .
I t is suggested in this paper that the bacteria do not act directly as much as by producing catalysts or by creating thc conditions for reactions which catalysts already present may carry out .
The bacterioloi ?
cal work of the Div ~ slon of Fisheries is testing these ypotheses .
Studies on marine bacteria are numerous , early work being concerned with their numbers , and later work with their taxonomy and function .
Zo Bell and Feltham ( 1934 ) consider that there are specific marine bacteria which differ from land bacteria in their ability to thrive in seawater .
They contend that sea water is bactericidal to land forms , but Waksman and Hotchkiss ( 1937 ) have shown that it is also bactericidal to marine forms .
I consider , from my own quite extensive work , that the existence of true marine forms is extremely doubtful , and believe that one can trace a gradation from soil forms through the estuarine flora , which also has something in common with the flora of fish spoilage , to the gram-negative marine flora recorded by Zo Bell and his co-workers .
The change from gram positive soil types to the gram-negative flora which normally pre-ponderntes in fresh water is analogous with the transition from the largely gram-positive mud flora of estuaries to the gram-negative flora characteristic of the sea .
There are times in each case where a mixture of types occurs , and except far from land , this is usual .
I have found also that many soil forms will grow or can be trained to grow on seawater media while oceanic forms usually adapt themselves to freshwater media .
In terms of genera , the genus Bacillus which is common in soils , is also common in estuarine muds , but rare in the sea itself .
The genus Coryaebacterilcnt is frequent in soils and C. globiforme , etc ., are common in the sea .
Many of the gram-negative marine forms seem to belong to the genus Mycoplanu described by Gray and Thornton ( 1928 ) from soil , and to the ubiquitous genus Pseudonaonas .
Micrococcus occurs in bath environments as does Sarcina .
The unique Sporosarcina ureae recorded by Gibson ( 193 7 ) in soil has been found by me in the sea ten miles offshore .
I should say that the truly marine bacterial flora is an adapted flora rather than a distinct one .
To clinch this point , wt : are now studying the flora of the continental shelf , but the recent loss of our research vessel has prevented me from having this final piece of evidence to discuss at this Meeting , although we have found the usual marine Mycoplana in muds of the Australian continental shelf .
In addition to the heterotrophic flora , the aueotrophic flora is common to both environments , e.g ., the purple bacteria , Azotobacter , Clostridium pasteurianum , etc.
The question of numbers of bacteria in the sea is an awkward one ; most observers find only a few bacteria in the sea except near land and in plankton swarms , but these observations have been made by cultural methods .
Cultural methods usually reveal only a small fraction of the total bacteria present in a given sample , and we have been trying to find some relationship between the number found by these methods and by direct counting .
A further difficulty is that , eveQ in freshwater , the distribution of bacteria does not follow the theoretical Poisson series , and duplicate samples can give a wide variation .
So far we have not succeeded in finding a relationship , and I think we may safely conclude .

6 69 ) that .
no such relationship exists .
My figures seem to suggest that the culture count approaches the direct count more closely as the number of bacteria present decreases .
This is possibly due to the more even distribution of bacteria ( i.e ., less clumping ) in the case of smaller populations .
I t is generally conceded that most bacteria in the sea are associated with surfaces , and , in the open sea , these surfaces consist largely of microscopic particles .
Once a bacterium adheres to a particle , surface phenomena come into play between the bacterium and the particle .
If the particle is inorganic , the adsorption phenomena on its surface will depend on its charge .
Nutritive substances may or may not be adsorbed on it , and i t may thus become a source of concentrated food material , stimulating the reproduction of bacteria which will multiply on its surface .
Toxic products from the bacteria may be adsorbed , thus limiting the number of bacteria which continue to exist on it , or may be removed in solution , removing factors which would inhibit bacterial growth .
This probably accounts for reports of different authors that the adsorption of bacteria results in their depletion and in their increase .
Rubentschik e t al. ( 193 6 ) have pointed this out .
If the particle is organic , the situation is more complicated .
Surface charge may vary over parts of the surface .
The particle itself may serve as food for ' bacteria , and as long as toxic products are removed in solution or by adsorption , rapid increase in the number of adsorbed bacteria will occur .
From all this it follows theoretically that the number of bacteria per particle will depend on the nature of the particle .
Because , in cultural methods of estimating bacterial populations , each particle will usually give rise to one colony of the dominant organism , and since it is the number of colonies which is counted , a constant relationship between cultural and direct methods would not be expected .
Table I shows the direct and plate counts of the same series of samples from estuarine muds taken over a 4 months ' period .
In the case of a small population of bacteria , direct counting methods have serious limitations and so far have not proved practicable in the open sea .
Perhaps the ultra centrifuge , which we have recently acquired , will help us with this problem , but it may still prove very difficult to separate minute organic particles , bacteria and microflagellates .
Differentiation between katabolic ( heterotrophic ) bacteria and anabo !
ic ( autotrophic ) microflagellates and bacteria is impcrtant on account of the different functions they perform , and i t is the function of these various organisms that is the real study of marine microbiology .
We know that photosynthetic organisms act as the food source for .
all animal life in the sea , except perhaps for bacteria which may be used directly as food by animals .
I t seems reasonable to believe , however , that weight for weight , bacteria are a relatively unimportant source of food compared with the photosynthetic organisms .
Bacteria , however , function as katabolic agents returning complex organic matter to the inorganic or simple organic materials which the plants can use .
I t has been considered in the past that bacteria alone can bring about this transformation and the puzzle has been to reconcile the small numbers of bacteria in the open sea with the amount of material which is known to be transformed .
I t has been thought that this could be explained by the transformation occurring at the bottom of the sea , but it is doubtful whether very much of the decomposing organic matter ever reaches the sea bottom , except on continental shelves .
Even if one concludes that the ratio of direct to culture count of bacteria is of the order of 1000 to 1 , and this seems to be true only for high bacterial populations , and where solid particles are numerous , - i t seems doubtful whether there are suacient bacteria in the sea to produce the chemical changes that are ascribed to them .
To what then are we to look for these changes ?
Kreps ( 1934 ) and Keys , Christensen and Krogh ( 1935 ) and others have suggested that there are free enzymes in the sea .
These ideas are based on the activity of water sterilized by filtration through a bacteria-proof Seitz filter or by mercuric chloride .
Mercuric chloride .
however .
is an enzvme poison , so that seems to rule out the possibility of bacterial or autolytic enzymes causing the transformations observed by Kreps ( 1934 ) , Keys e t al. ( 1935 ) and Cooper ( 1935 ) .
Two other theories seem to me to be possible :1 .
Non-specific organic or inorganic catalysts may be produced by bacteria and adsorbed by particles in the sea .
These substances would then be cumulative and would not be directly related to the bacterial population .
They could persist after the decline of the bacterial population .
- - 2 .
Bacteria may produce conditions which favour certain reactions and these reactions may be catalysed by substances which exist in the substrate .
Particles in the ocean would then serve not only to facilitate bacterial reproduction , but would increase the surface available for the action of adsorbed catalysts .
The reaction would continue in terms of mass action as long as one of the products was removed by adsorption , precipitation , etc ., and as long as the conditions were unaltered .
In either of these ways , small numbers of bacteria could produce a considerab !
e effect , greatly in excess of that expected by estimation of the bacterial population .
In the presence of plankton swarms , conditions would be suitable for very great bacterial activity , which can be shown to occur , and would also facilitate the activity of enzymic or catalytic processes .
I have found in my studies of these problems that I could not devise an adequate method of studying the reactions of such a sparse bacterial population as exists normally in the open sea .
Ordinary bacteriological methods require the use of micromethods which are not nearly sensitive enough for such work .
We have , therefore , turned our attention to muds where the environment differs somewhat from that in the open sea , but where the same general factors may , as a first hypothesis , be assumed to apply .
We have assumed for the time being that the action of smaller mud partic !
es will grossly resemble that on particles in the open ocean , and that study of bacterial activity in the presence of these particles will give us a clue to what is happening in the open sea .
This work is only in its very early stages , so I cannot even hazard a guess on the correctness of these assumptions .
As shown in Table 1 , we have found that the direct count of bacteria in mud is often many times the culture count , that bacteria are mainly adsorbed on particles , and that the number of bacteria adsorbed onto a particle has no relationship to the size of the particle , i.e ., svall particles may be covered with bacteria , while larger particles are bacteria-free and vice versa .
We have also found that up to 99.8 per cent .
of bacteria added to and shaken with a sterile mud will be adsorbed on the mud and disappear from the supernatant liquid on settling .
The maximum percentage adsorption is reached with about 1 x lo5 to 1 x loo bacterial per ml .
in seawater suspension , and does not , as might be expected , increase with decreasing numbers of bacteria in the suspension .
Rubentschik also found this peculiarity .
Adsorption also occurs on washed sterile diatomaceous earth , but not to the same extent as on muds .
Increased bacterial activity has been found to occur after adsorotion from a nutrient solution in the presence of the soiution .
This was greater on mud than on diatomaceous earth .
but controls showed that this increase was not entirely due to the increased nutriment in the mud .
I t was found .
however .
that sterile mud has some activity on sterile nutrient solutions , suggesting that there are present catalysts which are heat-stable to 12I0C .
for 20 minutes , and therefore cannot be enzymes .
It tends to confirm the findings of Kreps and others , though not their interpretation .
Further work is projecred to study the type and range of reactions , which may occur under these conditions , and to find out , if possible , the nature of these catalysts if such they be .
The distinction between enzyme and catalyst may seem unimportant , but catalysts are much more stab !
e than enzymes , usually are not specific , and are not necessarily of organic origin .
We have one clue from some work done on maneanese oxidation in soils in `` which i t was found that such substances as oxalacetic , citric and malonic acids catalysed this oxidation , which previously was thought to be entirely due to bacterial action in soils .

( 73 ) TOTAL FISHINC CATCH ' ER 0 UNIT FFORT .
Figure 2 .
The Australian trawl fishery had its beginnings in 1909 when H. C. Dannevig , of Norway , in the steam trawler `` Endeavour '' was .
commissioned by the Commonwealth Government to explore the trawling possibilities in this country .
This exploratory work was carried on for five years , covering most parts of the eastern and southern seaboards of Australia , until the `` Endeavour '' was b s t with all hands in 1914 .
As a result of Dannevig 's discoveries , the New South Wales State Government brought out some steam trawlers from England , and trawling was begun as a Government enterprise .
A start was made of trawling in 19 1 5 with 3 fleet of 3 trawlers , which later was increased to 7 .
In 1922 business was handed over to private firms .
More trawlers were brought out , and the catch rose to 1 1 million pounds in 1929 .
By the ' thirties the catch was falling , partly as a result of reduction in fleet , partly as a result of falling catch per boat .
By 1930 all the grounds that are now fished had been opened up .
The failing catch per boat presumably was due to the heavy fishing .
The catch per boat had been falling since 1927 , although the total catch did not fall till after 1929 .
But by 1931 the fleet had been reduced to 13 trawlers , and both the total catch and the catch per boat had begun to rise .
I have therefore suggested that a fleet of this'size is rather close to the desirable level .
The catch at this time is not : the theoretical optimum catch .
But at this level of fishing intensity the catch was beginning once more to expand , and we may therefore regard the size of the fleet as a sort of Empirical Optimum .
However , about 1937 and 1938 Danish seining was introduced into these waters , and the fleet began to expand .
The catch , too , began to expand ( though figures are suspect here ) , but the rate of catch suggests the beginning of a decline as one would expect if the fishery was indeed just beginning to recover from overfishing .
This point cannot be proved , because the war began to affect things ic the year 1939140 , after which the size of the fleet and of the catch werc falling , and the catch per boat ' rising .
The trawlers were being requisitioned during the war for mine-sweeping .
In 1942 , the very considerable fleet of Danish seiners was requisitioned for use in the war against the Japanese .
This resulted in a period of rest for the fish stocks .
The extent of this rest may be expressed as two ' years of moderate catch , two years of very low catch , and then another year of moderate catch .
With the end of the war the trawling fleet began to increase ; and in the flush of enterprise that followed the war , the total fishing effort reached a peak considerably higher than any hitherto .
As was to be expected , the catch rose also to a peakand then fell .
The rate of catch , or the catch per boat began to fall almost immediately after the war ; it has been falling now for four years , and is now about as low as i t has ever been .
These results were felt at the time in 1948 to be quite expected , and typical of an overfished fishery .
That is the burden of the main conclusions that can be drawn from the gross catch statistics ; but i t is necessary to stress that these figures all relate to total catch : that is , to all the fish species taken by the trawlers .
We now know that the gross figures are concealing some very interesting changes in the stock of what was the principal species-the flathead .
The rest of this talk is therefore more concerned with the fluctuating catch of the flathead .
BIOLOGY OF FLATHEAD Our research into the biology of the flathead has taken the line , chiefly , of making an estimate of the age-composition of the commercial catch .
This , indirectly ; involves a complete study of the biology of the species .
What follows , then , is a summary of the biology of the flathead , as it concerns the problem of age-determination-and then a brief account of the age-composition of the catch-and these results will be used to re-examine the catch figures .
The geographical range of the flathead is virtually contained within the heavy dark lines which mark off the limits of the trawl fishery .
The species therefore occupies a narrow strip of coastline , bounded on the seaward side by the deep Pacific waters , and to north and south by what are apparently unfavourable conditions .
The area of greatest natural concentration of the species is off Twofold Bay and perhaps extending up to Ulladulla .
To the north and south of this area the flathead stock occurs in smaller concentrations and is less able to withstand heavy fishing .
For some reason large numbers do not occur in Bass Strait to the west of Wilson 's Promontory ; only a few have been taken by trawlers working in that area .
In Bass Strait trawling is confined to the eastern shelf .
Spawning is in this species protracted and occur , q throughout the six summer months .
The egg is planktonic .
I t has been obtained by artificial fertilization ; but i t has no markedly distinctive features , and it so closely resembles some other cggs to be found in the plankton in the same months that no work has been done on its distribution in the sea .
Similarly , larvae belonging to members of the flathead family have been caught in numbers from time to time .
But there are at least half a dozen closely related species occurring in the range of the tiger flathead , and it has not yet been possible to identify the larva of the tiger flathead with certainty .
We know that spawning occurs virtually throughout the entire area of distribution of the flathead , and bearing in mind the strong currents and counter-currents that sweep the New South Wales coast , there can be little doubt that the flathead larvat are distributed in varying numbers throughout the coastal waters , and that genetic uniformity is the rule throughout the flathead stock .
I t would be interesting to know what proportion of the eggs and larvae is swept our beyond the edge of the shelf and lost .
I t would seem that the numbers would be considerable .
But as yet we have no knowledge about that .
We are next able to pick up the developing flathead at between 5 and 10 cm .
in length .
Experimental trawling using a finemeshed cover outside the codend has shown that the flathead of less than 3 years old are mostly to be found in the inshore waters of less than 30 or 3 1 fathoms ' depth .
We have taken them in numbers in 20 fathoms .
But of grounds shallower than this I am afraid we ca not say very much .
The bottom is mostly rough inside the 30 fathom line , and i t is difIicult to find any place where one can use a trawl for sampling these younger age-groups .
I t may be significant that we found the greatest concentrations of these early age-groups in the Twofold Bay area-the area which carries the greatest number of adults .
The important point is ' that this distribution of the young flathead largely places them out of the area of intensive trawling : Looking at i t in another way , however , i t may be that the intensive trawling kills off the young flathead which make bottom in the deeper water , so that the majority of the ones we found were inside this depth .
The truth of this point could be demonstrated only by experimental closure of some of the trawling grounds-to see whether young flathead might begin to be found in the deeper waters under those conditions .
In their second summer the male flathead spawn fcr the first time , and the females mostly spawn for the first time in the year following .
The maximum size to which the flathead grows is sixty or sixty-five centimetres-but there are few specimens at this size , and to-day the majority are around 3 5 cm .
The minimum legal length of this species is 3 3 cm .
Hence quite a large proportion of undersized fish is caught-about a quarter of those landed are under the legal size-mostly just under .
The legal minimum size was established by the State Fisheries Department before much research had been done on the species , but we have no quarrel with it .
A flathead of this size makes reasonable fillets , and it is in fact , about the size at which a high proportion of the flathead begin to be retained in the 3 inch codends .
Most of the males have spawned once before reaching this size , and i t is about the size at which the smallest females will begin to spawn for the first time .
Age determination Thc otoliths have been found to be best for this purpose ; but they are not good .
I t has been found that above a fish-length of 9 cm .
the otolith grows in length in proportion to the fish .
Length is measured from the centre to the posterior tip .
The practice has therefore been made of measuring the intermediate lengths by means of an eye-piece micrometer .
This was found to be a great aid in determining the true age of an otolith , in thope cases where the record is confused by supernumerary annuli .
Supernun ~ erary annuli are the great diffculty in interpreting these otoliths .
The annulus is formed in midwinter .
Spawning is in summer .
I t is not clear what actually causes translucent growth to be laid down in the otolith .
But i t does seem likely that the poor condition of the fish resulting from spawning during the summer may be an indirect cause of the formation of some of the supernumerary annuli .
I have not been able to demonstrate to what extent growth may be correlated with the formation of opaque and translucent material in the otolith .
In many fishes in which age-rings are clearly marked in the scales or otoliths , spawning runs into the period of slow winter growth : in the flathead , the two seasons are widely separated , and that may account for some of the irregularity in the annuli .
The otoliths figured in the plate must not be be taken as a fair sample .
They have been selected for the clarity with which they show the rings .
The smallest shows no annulus , and the next shows one .
The next shows two , and the next thrce-there is a very small band of oDaaue material A on the very edge .
his fish was caught in late June , so it had evidently formed its annulus a little early and had already begun to put on opaque growth .
In the next , the innermost annulus cannot be made out clearly in the photograph , but there are three others outside it , making a total of four , with opaque growth on the edge .
In the last there are four distinct annuli .
The fish was taken in January , so its age would be exactly four years .
In all otoliths the first zone of opaque g o w t h represents an incomplete year-between 3 and 9 months .
One of the most important verifications of the validity of such age-determinations was that when we eventually obtained large samples of the smaller age-groups ( by means of the experimental trawling ) , their length-frequencies clearly indicated the representative age-groups , and the modes of these agegroups agreed very closely with the actual calculated intermediate lengths which we had been obtaining for the past year or two , on theoretical grounds , from work on the otoliths .
Growtb From the calculated intermediate .
lengths obtained from the otoliths we have constructed some approximate average growth-curves .
The material was divided up according to sex and according to locality : ( Figure 3 ) .
It is seen - .
I 1 2 , L d - 5 L g L 7 that there is a small difierence in gowth-rate between the sexes .
The males grow more slowly than the females .
There are also 1oca : ity digerences .
The fish frcm the northernmost lociities grow fastest , and those from the south grow slowest .
The curves have not been produced down to the origin , because the first increment does not represent a full year 's growth .
AGE-COMPOSITION OF THE CATCH The construction of an average growth-curve was not the primary objective in estabiishing a method for age-determinafion .
What was aimed at was an analysis of the commercial catch into its constituent age-groups ( Figure 4 ) .
NUMBERS hand axis gives the actual numbcrs of each agegroup caught in each year-in millions of fish .
The earlier year-194 1 142-could not be treated in this way , and the numbers are shown as percentages .
I t will b : seen that the proportion in which the difierent age-groups occur is very regular .
The III-group is the most important , followed by the IVeroutx Onlv one vear is aberrant-1947148 .
In `` .
that year th ; 1 ~ - ~ r o u ~ is more important ihan the III-group .
The annual reduction in numbers after the III-group is about 75 per cent , and it gradually increases with age .
In the sixth histogam , on the upper right hand side , this material is averaged and the relative proportion of each age-group is expressed in terms of wcight .
In this case the IV-group is - - the most important , followed by the III-group .
The important features to notice in this series of histograms are , firstly , the virtual absence of fish over VI years old , and secondly the absence of violent year to year fluctuations in numbers of the different age-groups .

The next year 0 % n + m + m + n + XI + ( 1344145 ) saw the maximum catch of flathead , and for thc four followinn years the catch has declined .
Figure 4 .
I want to stress thatrhe actual total catch of flat - Sampling of flathead is simplified by the fact that alniost all the flathead catch is sold in the Sydney Fish Market .
We therefore concentrated on random ' monthly length samples which were made representative of the whole commercial catch .
From about one-tenth of these specimens we obtaimd otol i th ~ .
From the age-analysis of these otslith samples , we were able to weigh the random length samples , so as to get a good estimate of the proportions of each age-group in commercial catches .
Since we know the size of the commercial catch in each month we can , from this , work out the actual weight of each age-group , or the actual numbers in each age group , in the commercial catch .
The estimates of the catches for the four years on the left of this figure have been obtained in this way .
The left head has declined , till it is now a little over onethird of the level of five years ago .
On the other hand , the trawlers have had to make up their catches with second and third quality species-the morwong and nannygai .
These species were formerly not caught , or at any rate were landed only in very small numbers .
The prices of these two species are approximately three-quarters and a half that of flathead .
I t is seen that the catch of morwong rose to nearly 4 million pounds .
Then it in turn declined in the last year .
I repeat that these are actual catch figures , not rate of catch .
Actually , the rate of catching of morwong is little more than half that of three years ago .
It , too , is probably being overfished at present .
Then , taking the nannygai , a chea er fish again , it is seen that the catch has risen ?
to 5 / Z million pounds-it is now greater than that of either the morwong or flathead , and , in fact , the rate of catch is still rising .
But it must be obvious that it is only a matter of time before the nannygai also will feel the effects of the heavy fishing .
Meanwhile , the effect of all this on the total catch is that there has been an overall reduction of 2 million pounds in the !
ast 2 years .
I t must be obvious from this table that we have here to do with a case of very severe overfishing .
The fluctuations shown in this table cannot be due to natural population fluctuations-at least , not in the case of ' the flathead .
This possibility was eliminated by the work on the age-composition of the catch .
Since the first paper on the trawl fishery was published ( when the catch was still rising and was a record ) two years ' catch figures have become available ; and i t is clear that the catch of those two years amply supports the conclusions reached thennamely , that the fishery was over-cxploitcd , and that unless the fishing efort was redwed , the actual total catch would fall .
This prediction has come true .
But when we come to examine the flathead catch in the vast , an even more remarkable and rather puzzling situation becomes apparent .
I said that we had no catch figures for individual species in the early years .
That is not strictly true .
We have some series of old trawlers ' logs covering three periods .
Now these logs give the catch of flathead , and the total catch of the individual boats to which they refei From this we can get the proportion of flathead in the catch of the individual boat .
We appear to be on safe ground in assuming that this is much the same as the proportion of flathead in the catch of the whole fleet a t the time .
These figures are given in Table 2 .
I t is apparent that the proportion of flathead in the catch shows considerable regularity .
Column 3 shows the number of boats from which the proportion was derived .
The table has been continued down to recent years to make it complete .
In the early days more than 80 per cent .
of the catches were flathead .
In the next period ( 1928 - 1933 ) there was a steady reduction in the proportion of flathead from 95 to 65 per cent .
This is the period of falling catch per unit effort .
In column 4 I have calculated what the actual total flathead catch would have been on this basis , and in column 5 the rate of catch .
In the next period ( 1937138-1941142 ) the percentage of flathead was still falling , and so continued till the most recent period , until last year there was only 9 per cent of flathead in the catch .
( Thcse figures refer only to the steam trawlers , and do not include the Danish seiners ) .
The astonishing fact is that in the early days1928 , 1929 , 1930 - - - even after there had been considerable exploitation of the fishery , the actual ( estimated ) total flathead catch was between ten and thirteen million pounds .
And to-day the total flath a d catch is 2.1 million pounds .
In the right hand column you have the calculated fall in the rate of catch as it applies to the steam trawlers .
The figure to-day is less than one-tenth that of 1930 .
What is one to make of a reduction of that magnitude ?
Can it be explained as merely ovcrfishing ?
Further , why was the postwar recovery of the flathead fishery not more pronounced ?
This and other questions , which are dealt with in detail in a paper now in the press , can best bc explained , I think , on the assumption that in this fishery the number of recruits is largely governed by the number of spawning adults .
Hitherto , the reverse has usually been believed true of sea fisheries .
As yet it can only be a hypothesis in this case .
But I Mieve that we can explain along these lines the slow , or rather the halting recovery of the flathead stocks as a result of the war-time respite ; and also , perhaps , this apparently cumulative effect of overfishing shown by the figures in this table .
The conservation measure which we are advocating , which we have been advocating for the past two or three years , is a reduction of the trawling fleet to about the level of 193 Y-the point at which the trawlfish stocks as a whole were beginning to show signs of recovery .
As an additional measure , we advocate the complete closure of the Botany ground to fishing for an experimental period .
That is the ground immediately south of Sydney Heads .
I t used to carry an enormous quantity of flathead , and flathead still do show up there in numbers a t about spawning time .
I t is felt that this would be a most convenient and useful ground on which to study the effects of closure .

C.S.I.11.0 .
Division of FFllerles , Australia , ( Hereafter , these groups will be referred to as the western and eastern subspecies-the western subspecies has 25 to 30 gillrakers , and the eastern bas j j to 3 8. These juveniles of the western subspecies which arc found in the south-east of the continent , were fish of from 6 cm .
length ( mere fingerlings ) up to 30 or 40 cm .
in length ( at which size they are severaI years old ) .
I t was found that in Tasmanian and Victorian waters , and in Bass Strait generally , the two subspecies often occurred mixed in the one shoal .
Such shoals might be preponderantly of one or the other subspecies .
In Figure 1 , the distribution of the eastern subspecies is distinguished from that of the western subspecies by hatching , and the area where the mixed shoals occurs is shown similarly .
There is no information yet from the west coast of Tasmania .
Though it is known that there are salmon there , i t is not known to which subspecies they belong .
The zone of mixing of the two subspecies in Victorian watersbetween Wilson 's Promontory and the south-east corner of the continent-is of some interest .
It happens ' to be the approximate division between two previously well-established zoogeographical areas .
The next step in this work was to obtain samples of salmon from New Zealand and from Lord Howe Island .
I t had been effectively established by the work on the gillrakers that there was no appreciable interchange between the stocks supporting the fisheries of the south-east and of the south-west , but it was possible that there was interchange between New Zealand and New South Wales waters .
Two good samples of New Zealand salmon ( about $ 0 fish ) were obtained ; and a small sample was obtained frim Lord Howe Island ( about 10 fish ) .
Unfortunately i t has so far been impossible to get any fish from Norfolk Island .
The samples obtained were compared with New South Wales specimens by means of 18 proportional measurements , ahd by counting scales , fin-rays , vertebrae and so on .
Though there were so few in the sample from Lord Howe Island , it was apparent that one had to do here with a very different looking fish .
The head was shorter than in the others , and the body was much stouter ; in addition , the flesh was extremely oily .
Oil is very low in Australian salmon at all times of the year , and was low in both of the New Zealand samples .
All these characteristics of the Lord Howe Island fish point to good feeding and fast and that conclusion is confirmed by the scales .
Of more importance , it was found that the gillrakers were substantially different in number in comparison with the finding for the eastern subspecies of Australia : they varied between 36 and 41 , and this feature seems to distinguish the Lord Howe Island salmon from all others .
The New Zealand salmon were much less distinct from the New South Wales stock than were the Lord Howe Island salmon .
However it is almost certain that they are distinct from the New South Wales salmon , because there was a difference of about 1 scale in the girth and about 0.34 in the dorsal ray counts .
The material is not yet full enough to eliminate any chance that sex and year-group may be affecting these meristic counts ; but the data do show that if either variable has an effect , it is not of such magnitude as to invalidate the differences in the girth scale count .
The proportional measurements have not yet been tested statistically , but there appears to be absolutely no difference between the New Zealand and the New South Wales salmon .
The two are undoubtedly very closely allied .
There are considerable differences , as stated above , between the New South Wales and the Lord Howe Island salmon , mainly involving the short head and the great girth of the Lord Nowe Island fish .
Such differences are not necessarily genetic , but might be merely the effect of particularly good conditions in the waters around Lord Howe Island .
However there are other differences , such as the length of .
the and fin and the diamekr of the eye , which do not seem to be merely the effect of good feeding , but probably mark off the Lord Howe Island salmon as a separate breeding population from the other groups studied here .
Further samples were obtained from Western Australia and , after some difficulty , several dozen specimens from South Australia .
It should be pointed out that all along this study has been hampered by the fact that this species has a very wide distribution .
I t is usually sporadic in its appearance , and its distribution covers some completely uninhabited stretches of coastline .
As previous : ^ stated , there are two centres of the fishery , south-east and south-west .
In the south-west , the roads all run inland and not coastwise , and the coastline is desolate .
East of Esperance there is ncthing but desert .
From Ade !
aide to Melbourne is also sparsdy inhabited , with no salmon fishery .
The west ccast of Tasmania is very desolate , with no fishery .
There are therefore many gaps in the records of the species which must be filled in by supposition , or at times by fewer samples than one would Iike .
The South Australian specimens came from the `` Gulf '' area .
It was found that they agreed very closely with the samples from Western Australia in everything but the girth scale count-and that apparent difference may prove not to be significant when larger samples are obtained .
Even more significant perhaps , was the growthrate of the South Australian salmon , as shown by their scales .
The faster growth and larger size of the West Australian salmon , compared with the New South Wales salmon , has been previously mentioned .
Though the South Australian fish were youngmostly 2 and 3 year 014s-their scales showed a powth-rate that agrecd very well with the West Australian salmon .
We may now examine the tables of gillraker counts , girth scales and dorsal rays .
These figures do not embrace all the material available , but have been drawn up simply for the purpose of illustration .
It must be emphasized that the work is to be regarded as very incomplete as yet .
The samples in this .
table have been divided up into tht possible or suspected discrete populations .
I t will be seen that , as far as gillrakers are concerned , there is no doubt about the break between the eastern and western subspecies .
There is probably no significant difference between New Zealand and New South Wales , nor between Western Australia , South Australia and south-east Australia .
There is a single instance of a salmon with a high gillraker count taken in Western Australia .
Presumably there is some admixture between the two subspecies .
They have very similar habits , and no doubt cross-breeding might occur between isolated specimens and the main body of fish .
These tables also give the distribution of the two other meristic features which show variability .
Taking the dorsal rays first , the material obviously falls into two groups , corresponding with the two subspecies distinguishable from the gillrakers .
The girth scales , however , are separable into three or four groups .
The West Australian counts may or may not be significantly different from those of South Australia , but are significantly different from the eastern sub-species .
The New Zealand samples also differ significantly from those from Australia .
Again it is necessary to stress that this material has not yet been fully tested to determine whether age - - or year-groups or sex-are causing slight difference between means .
But it is known that these factors are n3t causing large differences , such as are apparent in these tables .
Th : other obvious meristic features were also counted-vertebrae , and the other fin rays and spines-but all showed great constancy and little likelihood of being useful .
Some other scale counts were m a d e a b o v e the lateral line , and around the caudal peduncle ; they seemed to show parallel variation with the girth scales , but because the girth scales could be counted with greater certainty , the other scale counts were neglected .
So far , this paper has been concerned mainly with the taxonomic characters by which the various subspecies and populations may be revealed in this species .
But there is a mass of rather scattered information concerning habits , migrations , distribution of young , and so on , which all fails into place if interpreted in the light of the foregoing results .
First of all , in New Zealand i t is known there are large numbers of salmon fry which are seen a t times in shallow water .
This is pretty conclusive evidence that the salmon spawn in New Zealand waters .
The same is probably true of Lord Howe Island , where young salmon are taken from time to time .
Since the salmon are also known to spawn in New South Wales waters , this is confirmatory evidence that the New Zealand salmon are distinct and independent of the New South Wales stoclr .
As mentioned earlier , there are reports of salmon shoals half way across the Tasman Sea , and it may be that there is some exchange between the populations .
The adults of the eastern subspecies undertake a rather scattered migratory movement .
They spend winter and spring in New South Wales , and in summer and autumn move south .
They spawn off the southeast corner and apparently move further south , but subsequently move north .
The fry are carried south in the current .
The Tasmanian waters are the nursery ground for this subspecies ; there are no juveniles in New South Wales waters .
But in Tasmanian waters and in Bass Strait there are also large numbers of young of the western subspecies-passibly they predominate .
As mentioned earlier , the two subspecies often occur in Tasmanian waters as mixed shoals-one or other subspecies predominating , or else the two occur about equally .
There is a striking difference in the growthrate shown by the two subspecies , even at this stagethe western subspecies appears to grow almost twice as fast as the eastern subspecies , in spite of the fact that the fish seem to be living under almost identical conditions .
The difference in growth-rate is so marked that i t may be possib !
e later to distinguish between members of the two subspecies on this character alone , without reference to the gillrakers .
In Victorian waters the juveniles appear to be a !
most all members of the western subspecies .
Now the origin of these juveniles of the western species is obscure .
They occur in fairly large numbers as mere fingerlings .
They must , theref ~ re , be spawned somewhere in the vicinity .
The set of the currents in this region is to the easc .
By analogy with the situation in the east , it is tempting to suppose that these fry have been carried to the south and east from somewhere on the South Australian coast .
Since there is no fishery for salmon along this part of the ccast a !
l this must be rather suppositional .
But that is certainly what i t looks like .
There must be a large population of adults of the western subspecies somewhere on this part of the coast , to the west , to account for the large numbers of fry in Victorian waters and around Tasmania .
I t appears therefore that when they reach maturity , or earlier , the mixed shoals of juveniles which occur round Tasmania split up into their respective subspecies , the members of the eastern subspecies moving to the north and east , and those of the western subspecies moving to the north and west .
In Western Australia the behaviour of the salmon is strikingly parallel to that of the eastern subspecies , as we know i t in New South Wales and Tasmanian waters .
There is a winter fishery a t Hopetoun and Esperance ; only a few of the fish are taken west of Hopetoun .
In summer , with developing roe , the fish make a westward movement and spawn in the Cape Leeuwin-Naturaliste area in April and May .
Subsequently there follows a return movement of the fingerlings and first year fish .
A few occur around the south-west , but the real concentration is in Esperance area and perhaps eastward of it .
These movements are to be considered in connection with the current flow of this area .
Now what is particularly interesting is that half-grown salmon are almost unknown in Western Australia .
Some shoals of three and four year old fish put in a brief appearance at Esperance in the summer .
But they are never taken in any numbers around the south-west corner .
I t will be remembered that it was stated earlier that there was no fishing in all the area of the Great Australian Bight east of Esperance .
I t seems very likely that these juvenile salmon are distributed through the Bight , and perhaps even further east .
The similarity of the samples of two and three year old salmon from South Australia therefore becomes important .
These two age-groups are commonly caught in the Gulfs of South Australia .
That is highly suggestive .
I t seems that the salmon of this area ( South Australia ) are the juveniles of the stock of large , fast-grown salmon upon which the West Australian fishery is dependent ; just as the stocks of salmon in Tasmanian waters include the juveniles upon which the fishery of New Sovth Wales is dependent .
To what population then do the juveniles of the western subspecies , which are found in Victorian and Tasmanian waters , belong ?
They have no connection with the New South Wales fish .
Where are the adults that give rise to them ?
They can hardly have been distributed from Western Australia .
There is , as a matter of fact , no record whence these juveniles can have come .
The South Australian-Victorian stretch of coast , as mentioned before , is known to be populated with salmon , but is virtually unfished .
I t seems that one must postulate at least one further population which spawns somewhere in this region , and whose fry are carried to the south-east , to be found later in Victorian and Tasmanian waters .
A hypothetical boundary between this presumed population , and the supposed eastern limit of the south-west Australian population , has therefore been dotted in .
The extent of present ignorance about this population has been stressed , but the fact must not be lost sight of that there arc these juvenile members of the western subspecies , occurring in very large numbers , in Victorian and Tasmanian onshore waters ; and one must somehow account for them .
Our present ignorance is due chiefly to the lack of observations along the South Australian-Victorian stretch of coastline .
This account completes the picture so far as i t has been worked out .
It can be described partly as well-established fact , partly as a working hypothesis , which will guide and direct future work .
The Iimits of the stock on which the New South Wales fishery is based have been demarcated ; and progress has been made in demarcating the limits of the stock of the south-western fishery .
There is just one further point .
I t may have occurred to some readers that the two subspecies would be better described as two , full , distinct species .
There is a striking difference in the gillrakers , and probably in the rays of the dorsal fin .
No doubt these characters would be sufficient in some genera of fishes to create a new species .
However , in the present case there is one other species of the genus Arril ~ is-that is , Arripis georgianz ~ .
~ , the Tommy Ruff ( see Plate 2 ) .
The Tommy Ruff is a considerably smaller species-the two have not been magnified to an equal degree in the plate .
I t will be seen that this species is morphologically very different from the salmon .
The eye is larger , the snout is shorter , thc caudal peduncle is narrower .
Also the scale counts and fin-ray counts are very different from any of the populations of salmon .
All this is in contrast with the salmon-between the populations of which there is a high degree of uniformity in all but one or two characters .
If , therefore , one were to split the salmonArripis tmtta , into a number of species , then the Tommy Ruff-Arrii ) is georgian ~ ts , would have to be removed from the genus and a new genus created for it , which would then be a monotypic genus .
I t seems best , then , all things considered , to leave the salmon as a single species , but to split it up into two subspecies , in each of which there i s perhaps more than one population .

Division of FFllerles , Australia , ( Hereafter , these groups will be referred to as the western and eastern subspecies-the western subspecies has 25 to 30 gillrakers , and the eastern bas j j to 3 8. These juveniles of the western subspecies which arc found in the south-east of the continent , were fish of from 6 cm .
length ( mere fingerlings ) up to 30 or 40 cm .
in length ( at which size they are severaI years old ) .
I t was found that in Tasmanian and Victorian waters , and in Bass Strait generally , the two subspecies often occurred mixed in the one shoal .
Such shoals might be preponderantly of one or the other subspecies .
In Figure 1 , the distribution of the eastern subspecies is distinguished from that of the western subspecies by hatching , and the area where the mixed shoals occurs is shown similarly .
There is no information yet from the west coast of Tasmania .
Though it is known that there are salmon there , i t is not known to which subspecies they belong .
The zone of mixing of the two subspecies in Victorian watersbetween Wilson 's Promontory and the south-east corner of the continent-is of some interest .
It happens ' to be the approximate division between two previously well-established zoogeographical areas .
The next step in this work was to obtain samples of salmon from New Zealand and from Lord Howe Island .
I t had been effectively established by the work on the gillrakers that there was no appreciable interchange between the stocks supporting the fisheries of the south-east and of the south-west , but it was possible that there was interchange between New Zealand and New South Wales waters .
Two good samples of New Zealand salmon ( about $ 0 fish ) were obtained ; and a small sample was obtained frim Lord Howe Island ( about 10 fish ) .
Unfortunately i t has so far been impossible to get any fish from Norfolk Island .
The samples obtained were compared with New South Wales specimens by means of 18 proportional measurements , ahd by counting scales , fin-rays , vertebrae and so on .
Though there were so few in the sample from Lord Howe Island , it was apparent that one had to do here with a very different looking fish .
The head was shorter than in the others , and the body was much stouter ; in addition , the flesh was extremely oily .
Oil is very low in Australian salmon at all times of the year , and was low in both of the New Zealand samples .
All these characteristics of the Lord Howe Island fish point to good feeding and fast and that conclusion is confirmed by the scales .
Of more importance , it was found that the gillrakers were substantially different in number in comparison with the finding for the eastern subspecies of Australia : they varied between 36 and 41 , and this feature seems to distinguish the Lord Howe Island salmon from all others .
The New Zealand salmon were much less distinct from the New South Wales stock than were the Lord Howe Island salmon .
However it is almost certain that they are distinct from the New South Wales salmon , because there was a difference of about 1 scale in the girth and about 0.34 in the dorsal ray counts .
The material is not yet full enough to eliminate any chance that sex and year-group may be affecting these meristic counts ; but the data do show that if either variable has an effect , it is not of such magnitude as to invalidate the differences in the girth scale count .
The proportional measurements have not yet been tested statistically , but there appears to be absolutely no difference between the New Zealand and the New South Wales salmon .
The two are undoubtedly very closely allied .
There are considerable differences , as stated above , between the New South Wales and the Lord Howe Island salmon , mainly involving the short head and the great girth of the Lord Nowe Island fish .
Such differences are not necessarily genetic , but might be merely the effect of particularly good conditions in the waters around Lord Howe Island .
However there are other differences , such as the length of .
the and fin and the diamekr of the eye , which do not seem to be merely the effect of good feeding , but probably mark off the Lord Howe Island salmon as a separate breeding population from the other groups studied here .
Further samples were obtained from Western Australia and , after some difficulty , several dozen specimens from South Australia .
It should be pointed out that all along this study has been hampered by the fact that this species has a very wide distribution .
I t is usually sporadic in its appearance , and its distribution covers some completely uninhabited stretches of coastline .
As previous : ^ stated , there are two centres of the fishery , south-east and south-west .
In the south-west , the roads all run inland and not coastwise , and the coastline is desolate .
East of Esperance there is ncthing but desert .
From Ade !
aide to Melbourne is also sparsdy inhabited , with no salmon fishery .
The west ccast of Tasmania is very desolate , with no fishery .
There are therefore many gaps in the records of the species which must be filled in by supposition , or at times by fewer samples than one would Iike .
The South Australian specimens came from the `` Gulf '' area .
It was found that they agreed very closely with the samples from Western Australia in everything but the girth scale count-and that apparent difference may prove not to be significant when larger samples are obtained .
Even more significant perhaps , was the growthrate of the South Australian salmon , as shown by their scales .
The faster growth and larger size of the West Australian salmon , compared with the New South Wales salmon , has been previously mentioned .
Though the South Australian fish were youngmostly 2 and 3 year 014s-their scales showed a powth-rate that agrecd very well with the West Australian salmon .
We may now examine the tables of gillraker counts , girth scales and dorsal rays .
These figures do not embrace all the material available , but have been drawn up simply for the purpose of illustration .
It must be emphasized that the work is to be regarded as very incomplete as yet .
The samples in this .
table have been divided up into tht possible or suspected discrete populations .
I t will be seen that , as far as gillrakers are concerned , there is no doubt about the break between the eastern and western subspecies .
There is probably no significant difference between New Zealand and New South Wales , nor between Western Australia , South Australia and south-east Australia .
There is a single instance of a salmon with a high gillraker count taken in Western Australia .
Presumably there is some admixture between the two subspecies .
They have very similar habits , and no doubt cross-breeding might occur between isolated specimens and the main body of fish .
These tables also give the distribution of the two other meristic features which show variability .
Taking the dorsal rays first , the material obviously falls into two groups , corresponding with the two subspecies distinguishable from the gillrakers .
The girth scales , however , are separable into three or four groups .
The West Australian counts may or may not be significantly different from those of South Australia , but are significantly different from the eastern sub-species .
The New Zealand samples also differ significantly from those from Australia .
Again it is necessary to stress that this material has not yet been fully tested to determine whether age - - or year-groups or sex-are causing slight difference between means .
But it is known that these factors are n3t causing large differences , such as are apparent in these tables .
Th : other obvious meristic features were also counted-vertebrae , and the other fin rays and spines-but all showed great constancy and little likelihood of being useful .
Some other scale counts were m a d e a b o v e the lateral line , and around the caudal peduncle ; they seemed to show parallel variation with the girth scales , but because the girth scales could be counted with greater certainty , the other scale counts were neglected .
So far , this paper has been concerned mainly with the taxonomic characters by which the various subspecies and populations may be revealed in this species .
But there is a mass of rather scattered information concerning habits , migrations , distribution of young , and so on , which all fails into place if interpreted in the light of the foregoing results .
First of all , in New Zealand i t is known there are large numbers of salmon fry which are seen a t times in shallow water .
This is pretty conclusive evidence that the salmon spawn in New Zealand waters .
The same is probably true of Lord Howe Island , where young salmon are taken from time to time .
Since the salmon are also known to spawn in New South Wales waters , this is confirmatory evidence that the New Zealand salmon are distinct and independent of the New South Wales stoclr .
As mentioned earlier , there are reports of salmon shoals half way across the Tasman Sea , and it may be that there is some exchange between the populations .
The adults of the eastern subspecies undertake a rather scattered migratory movement .
They spend winter and spring in New South Wales , and in summer and autumn move south .
They spawn off the southeast corner and apparently move further south , but subsequently move north .
The fry are carried south in the current .
The Tasmanian waters are the nursery ground for this subspecies ; there are no juveniles in New South Wales waters .
But in Tasmanian waters and in Bass Strait there are also large numbers of young of the western subspecies-passibly they predominate .
As mentioned earlier , the two subspecies often occur in Tasmanian waters as mixed shoals-one or other subspecies predominating , or else the two occur about equally .
There is a striking difference in the growthrate shown by the two subspecies , even at this stagethe western subspecies appears to grow almost twice as fast as the eastern subspecies , in spite of the fact that the fish seem to be living under almost identical conditions .
The difference in growth-rate is so marked that i t may be possib !
e later to distinguish between members of the two subspecies on this character alone , without reference to the gillrakers .
In Victorian waters the juveniles appear to be a !
most all members of the western subspecies .
Now the origin of these juveniles of the western species is obscure .
They occur in fairly large numbers as mere fingerlings .
They must , theref ~ re , be spawned somewhere in the vicinity .
The set of the currents in this region is to the easc .
By analogy with the situation in the east , it is tempting to suppose that these fry have been carried to the south and east from somewhere on the South Australian coast .
Since there is no fishery for salmon along this part of the ccast a !
l this must be rather suppositional .
But that is certainly what i t looks like .
There must be a large population of adults of the western subspecies somewhere on this part of the coast , to the west , to account for the large numbers of fry in Victorian waters and around Tasmania .
I t appears therefore that when they reach maturity , or earlier , the mixed shoals of juveniles which occur round Tasmania split up into their respective subspecies , the members of the eastern subspecies moving to the north and east , and those of the western subspecies moving to the north and west .
In Western Australia the behaviour of the salmon is strikingly parallel to that of the eastern subspecies , as we know i t in New South Wales and Tasmanian waters .
There is a winter fishery a t Hopetoun and Esperance ; only a few of the fish are taken west of Hopetoun .
In summer , with developing roe , the fish make a westward movement and spawn in the Cape Leeuwin-Naturaliste area in April and May .
Subsequently there follows a return movement of the fingerlings and first year fish .

BIOLOGICAL , ECOLOGICAL AND LIFE HISTORY STUDIES Basic to the development of rational plans for the exploitation and management of the tuna resources of the mid Pacific is the accumulation of the fundamental facts regarding the biology of the several tuna species , the conditions of the sea in which they live , and the relationships of the oceanic conditions to the life and behavior of the tunas and to the organisms upon which they feed .
Through accumulation and analysis of morphometric measurements made on tuna from different regions , to be supplemented later by tagging experiments , we are attempting to determine whether or not the population of each species in different regions of the Pacific are or are not independent of each other and , in the former case , the geographical limits of the several populations .
Since the tunas , - being high-seas , pelagic fishes are oriented to conditions of the oceanic environment , we are attempting to learn how the variations in abundance and behavior of the tunas are related to the environment as a basis for devising improved fishing methods .
The variation of potential productivity of different sea areas is also of importance for reaching conclusions as to which regions are capable of high sustained yields of tunas .
To thzse ends we are conducting oceanographical surveys with the SMITH to correlate with the results of exploratory fishing by the other two vessels .
Particularly important in this respect is the study of the equatorial and counter equatorial current system and the enrichment by upwellings associated therewith .
Specific experiments to correlate occurrence of tunas with local variations in environmental conditions will be conducted by all three vessels .
Study of the age and rate of growth of the tunas , important to the problems of population dynamics of these species , is being undertaken by means of study of size frequencies and markings on scales and vertebrae .
Preliminary results for the size frequency approach have been most illuminating and have indicated a rapid rate of growth of species studied .
Study of scales and vertebrae seems to be less fruitful , but the subject has not been covered thoroughly as yet , and this deserves considerable attention since i t is desirable , if possible , to devise methods of determining the age of individual fish .
The subject of maturation and spawning of tunas , important both with respect to seasonal rariations in availability and with respect to the problems of population dynamics , has been until recently very obscure .
We have good evidence that the yellon-fin , biq-eyed and skipjack all spawn near the Hawaiian Islands , as well as elsewhere , and we are planning [ Q undertake research to learn something of the geographical , vertical and seasonal distriburion of spawning in this region .
- - Th : primary fishing technique , both on the Anmican West Coast and Hawaii , is by means of using live bait to chum-up fish to be captured by hook and line .
Unfortunately , the small fish used for live bait are notedly scarce among the various islands of the mid Pacific .
It , therefore , is of importance to learn enough about their biology and behavior , and about those factors in their physiolugy re !
ated to holding and transporting them , to enable the most efficient use of the quantities available .
EXPERIMENTAL FISHING TO DEVELOP NEW GEAR AND NEW FISHING TECHNIQUES Standard forms of gear ( live bait , purse seines , long lines ) in use in other regions may or may not be effective means of capturing tunas in the new regions which we are seeking to develop , and i t is almost certain that even if they are effective to some degree , they may be improved in eficiency .
The ~ roblem of improving gear of the several types and of dcvising new kinds of gear may be approached by applying various physical principles in the light of knowledge of the behavior of the fish and of the practical problems of shipboard operations , and involve both bio !
ogical and engineering techniques .
We shall seek through biological study of the reactions of tuna to various stimuli , both in captivity and at sea , to arrive a t new ideas for the development of effective gear .
Prior to the arrival of these results , however , there is a great deal to be accomplished in the way of learning the limitations of such conventional gear as the purse seine in this new region by trying it out on fish schools under actual operating conditions and so arrive empirically at ideas for improving gear and techniques .
I t is expected that the knowledge of relation of distribution and behavior to environmental factors , mentioned earlier , will be also of value in the development of new gear and techniques of fishing .
This should be particularly true of such sub-surface gear as long lines , the depths of fishing of which formerly have been arrived at on a purely trial and error basis .
There also appears to be room for much profitable development , by means of improved materials and mechanization , of already well known fishing methcds .
The tuns long line seems particularl ~ .
likely to be made an effective and efficient gear by such an approach .
.
- This gear is used in the Hawaiian Islands and in Japan .
In the Hawaiian Islands a small boat carrying 4 or F men handle 20 or 30 `` baskets '' of gear by hand or by the aid of primitive line pullers .
Only the high price of fish , all of which go to the fresh market , makes this a profitable operation .
Japanese vessels of large size employ line haulers of more advanced design , a single vessel handling up to 200 baskets ; but crews of about 25 men are employed .
The rates of production per man are such that they would not be profitable under American ecoxlomic standards .
A t the same time , however , American fishermen , except in Hawaii , exploit only the young tunas which school a t the surface and are passing up the opportunity to fish the older fish which live at deeper levels .
I t seems likely that rather simple applications of technological progress to the long line fishing method may make possibie profitable American long line fisheries .
An attack will be made on this prob !
em the coming year .
EXPLORATORY FISHING TO DETERMINE GEOGRAPHICAL AND SEASONAL VARIATIONS IN ABUNDANCE AND AVAIJABILITY OF TUNU FOR LOCATING PROFIT - ABLE FISHING AREAS .
As noted earlier , the tunas are not evenly distributed in the sea , but are concentrated in time and space in accordance with pecuharities of the oceanic environment and the seasonal cycles of their lives .
The oceanographical variations are being measured as previously described and studies are being conducted of the life history and ecology of the tunas .
Intimately related with these studies is the practical application of their results , charting by means of fishing on a commercial or semi commercial scale the abundance of the fish and their availability to the fish ..
r men .
This exploratory fishing must be conducted by standard gear calibrated in regions of known tuna abundance to be meaningful in a commercial sense .
At present the only gear which we feel is sufficiently standard for this purpose is pole and line fishing , using live bait for chum .
This will be the method first employed in our exploratory activities .
The HENRY O'MALLEY and the HUGH M. SMITH will conduct live bait fishing this spring and summer in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands to give us a measurement of their effectivenezs as compared with the local live bait fishing boats and crews .
They will then conduct exploratory fishing in the Line Islands and Phoenix Islands regions .
Meanwhile , with the development of effective purse seining and long-lining techniques and gear , we h ~ p e to put ourselves in a position to standardizc these forms of gear later and to employ them also in exploratory operations .
REGION OF STUDY Although the area in which we are authorized to work extends from Hawaii to the Western Carolines and southward to Samoa , this is obviously too vast a region for us to study intensively at one time with the facilities available .
We have , therefore , chosen to study first a region contiguous to the Hawaiian Islands because of the simplified lopistics .
,. because of the fact that tunas are known to occur throughout the region in some quantity , and because it is logical for a commercial fishery to expand from its present location to the nearest adjacent pliofitable fishing area .
The region in which we propose to work initially reaches from Midway to the Phoenix Islands and from Hawaii to Malden Island .
While this is less than one third of our authorized area , i t is as large as we can handle a t once .
Indeed , perhaps i t is a bit too large .
Probably several years will be required to explore this area thoroughly , after which we will work further .

In this region , the University of Tlawaii and the Territorial Division of Fish and Game of Hawaii are also studying local tuna and bait fishery prob !

The programs of the three organizations are mutually supplementary and some phases are being undertaken jointly .

1 * Director of Fisheries , Sind Department of Fisheries , Karachi , Pakistan .
Flat-fishes , soles and the tongue-soles are caught in plenty by the trawler and in lesser numbers by the fishermen .
These are consumed only in good hotels and are not much esteemed by the local people .
Amongst the flat-heads , Batrachus and Platyccphalus .
+ are caught only occasionally .
Sharks .
skates .
saw-fishes and the hammerheaded sharks are represented by many species .
These are not consumed locally and are cured and exported .
There is no shark liver-oil factory in West Pakistan but the oil is extracted departmentally on a small scale and supplied o the veterinary and cther departments in East Pakistan .
Rays are represented by I f species , the Eagle-rays are quite common and occasionally are seen jumping out of water .
The rays also fall in the category of sharks and are not consumed locally , being cured * and exported .
Rhincodon or the Whale-shark is a seasonal visitor to our coast .
Three specimens , two males and one female , 21 ft. 41Y2 f t .
and 38 ft. respectively were caught in October 1949 by the local fishermen .
The oil extracted from the livers and tested in the laboratory showed very little trace of vitamin A. Prawns are caught in fairly large numbers , a little quantity used fresh and the rest cured and exported to Ceylon and Burma .
This commodity , if properly handied with the latest methods of preservation , can be n very good asset .
Other marine animals are edible oysters , pearl oysters ( Placuna ) and sponges , but the commercial value and utility has not yet been determined .
The total production of marine fish in Pakistan is 40,000 tons , about two-thirds is produced in the West and the rest in the East .
Of the total catch more than 60 % is cured and exported .
The methods of preservation are crude and primitive ; near Karachi and on the coast of Sind , coloured salt is issued to the fishermen for this purpose hence the quality is poor .
Salt is available in natural condition on the Makran coast .
' There are different types of country craft ( sailing boats varying in tonnage from $ 5 to 30 tons ) .
These are of f types on the Sind and of only one type on the Makran coast .
The smaller boats go out to the sea for about 24 to 30 hours but the bigger ones remain out 4 to 6 days at a stretch , these carry wooden boxes in which ice is taken for the preservation of the fish ; big fish are salted and kept in a separate hold .
The total number of boats is 10,200 .
No power fishing is done privately .
The nets range from cast nets to drag nets and stake nets ; bag nets are used only in the Karachi harbour , by a section of fishermen , otherwise these are not common in the West ; bag nets are extensively operated in East Pakistan .
In the open sea driftnets are in general use adjusted to the habits of the fish ; they are marked by two buoys , but the greatest drawback is that no lights are put up a t night with the result that some nets have been damaged by the trawler .
Long lines are also in use but by only few fishermen , single lines are quite common .
The population of fishermen is about 120,000 of whom one-third may be taken as actually engagcd in fishing .
The women also take part in the industry ; they twine the yarn in the houses but do not sell fi5h in the markets .
Th : fishermen have their own villages and do not like to live in the city even if given the opportunity to do so .
They are strong , sturdy , honest but illiterate and superstitious .
There is good scope for socio-economic work amongst them and great possibility of organising them into corporate bodies .
Shore installations are very unsatisfactory , there is only one cold-storage at Karachi at present but that too is not exclusively for fish .
Arrangements are being made to instal fairly big cold storage plants in both regions of Pakistan and the construction of ice factories is also under consideration by the Government .
The introduction of carrier launches with refrigerated hold is also proposed for bringing in fresh fish from far off places .
TRAWLING Trawling-although the Government has two fishing vessels , only the trawler ALA has made some fishing trips , the other vessel is not ready for operations .
ALA was purchased in England and brought to Karachi in October 1947 .
She has a length of 80 ft ., gross tonnage 81.24 , steel hull with a diesel Ruston Engine of 150 B.H.P .
She has a refrigerated hold to carry 30 tons of fish but at present is not in a working condition owing t ~ a faulty compressor cylinder .
Since her arrival , she has made more than 1 f trips .
The fishing operations have been carried out within a zone of depth from 10 to 20 fathoms .
The overations confirm the evidence of the charts relating to the ubiquity of mud bottom ; some hauls were made beyond Cape Monze lately indicating the rocky bottom and the presence of corals .
The fishing operations have yielded approximately 90 lbs , of fish per hour of fishing which means I , T00 lbs .
( about 13 cwt .
) per day 's absence .
The stock is identical with the catch of the local fishermen and is composed more or less of the same types as reported by other trawlers which have operated and are operating on the coasts of Bharat .
The results on the whole are not very encouraging but considering the short period of trial it would be hasty to infer anything definite .
There are no shore installations near the harbour for the preservation of the fish , no curing yard is in existence , markets are also in an unorganised condition , the result being that the fish has to be disposed off within two days at the most and consequently very low price .
The other factor is the proportion of n ~ n-edible fish , i.e ., sharks , skates , rays , etc ., which is sometimes as high as 40 % ; these give very little return and if nothing is done to gain more from these varieties , the trawling in tropical waters is bound to be handicapped to a great extent .
Trawling has been tried in the Bay of Bengal by `` GOLDEN CROWN '' in 1908-09 , by `` VIOLET '' and `` MARGARITA '' in 1907 and 190 8 in Ceylon and Madras waters , by `` LADY GOSCHEN '' on the Bombay and Sind coasts in 1921-22 and recently by `` MEENA '' off the Bombay coast .
The results of these trials are published and I need not go into details here .
Now , I will try to answer some of the questions raised by Dr. G. L. Kesteven in a recent report on the ' Fisheries of Pakistan ' in connection with the working of ALA .
`` The question then arises whether these results are attributable to the vessel , her crew , to the fish stock , or to the market .
'' To take the vessel first : i t is old and a lot of time is wasted on its repairs , involving heavy expenditure .
I t is small and the present operations are confined a t the most to 6 days , the average trip is usually of 4 days ' duration , thus i t remains in the port for an undue proportion of time .
It can not fish in squally weather or during the monsoon , and thus loses another 4 % to S months in the year on this account .
Whether trawling would be possible during the monsoon is a problem to be solved by a gear specialist and that too after some trials .
ALA carries a crew of 14 which is rather excessive for a vessel of this size : no commercial concern would keep more than 10 or 11 .
The Skipper has been recruited from England because nobody in this country was available who could handle this gear , the salary and allowances paid to the skipper are fairly high and may be cut down if the crew working with him can take over the trawling operations .
Fish stock is also a factor which requires serious consideration and careful analysis .
The proportion composition of the edible to non edible fish is normally in the ratio of 70:30 and unless more can be gained from the latter , income is bound to be less .
The present price of edible fish also is low and it is essential to get better prices to make the scheme more remunerative .
There should be proper arrangements for preservation and the fish should be sold in such quantities as not to lower the market price .
Marketing also must be organised on a proper basis because the conditions prevailing at present are far from satisfactory .
Now , taking as a whole , I may point out some features of trawling in the part and the present in our waters : 1 .
In every casi old vessels were purchased and much money was spent on reconditioning and overhauling ; maintenance cost was also very high .
2 .
These vessels were selected probably by those who had no idea of fishing in tropical waters and who did not think at the time of selection whether these vessels would be suitab !
e to the waters in which they would operate .
3 .
Trawling was tried in two or three .
places and the experience thus gained should have been a good indication for avoiding the same mistakes ; some other methods should have been tried instead , viz ., catching the surface and mid water fishes .
4 .
Operations were started without giving any serious consideration to the markets , marketing and the shore installations .
In the end I may say that the success of trawling is very doubtful in tropical waters owing to the stock of demersal fish and i t should be worthwhile to try craft and gear which may give us more fish from surface and mid water as these are the chief marketab !
e fish .
Yet another suggestion , the adjacent countries like Bharat and Pakistan , Burma and Indonesia , etc ., should co-operate and should not duplicate the investigations and research problems .
By this I mean that if a country is trying trawling the adjacent one should try other methods and compare the results at the annual meeting of the I.P.F.C .
or the officers of these countries should meet occasionally for consultation and to thrash out their common ~ roblems .
In this way great economy can be achieved and better results obtained by the member countries of this organisation .

The shape of the bag is maintained by three rattan rings , one at the entrance and one between the junction of two sections .
The rattan rings used are 1.9 1.5 and 0.9 meters in diameter respectively .
The catch can be removed a t any time through the distal end of the bags .

1 to 4 ) one sampan and T to 6 persons are required .
Traps may be set in a depth of 5-50 meters with preferably muddy bottom .
When the bottom is sandy , heavier anchors should be used .
It is difficult if not impossible to set Maw Ami on rocky bottom .
In setting the net the ropes , anchors and floats are laid down first to form the framework , then the wing , net and bags are set in position and tied to the framework .
EXPERIMENT ON FISHING OPERATION MA.W AM1 The principal objectives in carrying out these experiments were to determine the efficiency and economy of Masu Ami in comparison with the local Poh operating under similar conditions , and to ascertain whether i t would be.desirab !
e to introduce this gear to replace the Poh .
Prior to the first actual net setting much time was spent in preparing the parts of the trap and accessories and in practising technique of trap setting .
During the first trial the Japanese method of operation was followed , subsequently certain modifications were made to suit the local conditions .
Sitis selected for the tiap were locations w h e r ~ Poh stakes were operating nearby , but with no interference with each other 's fishing activities .
So far only three experiments have been perfofmed .
Further experiments Are now being planned and will ' de carried out in the Bay of Ban Pae , which is calm and well protected during the coming S.W .
monsoon season .
First Experiment Locality - Ket Point , about 2.5 miles South - west of Pae village .
Date - 7 November to 20 November , 1949 .
Conditions of the Site : Depth of water - 11.5 meters .
Bottom - sandy with littie mud .
Clcrrent - strong , uneven and w i t h different speed between the top and middle waters .
Actual fishing days - 2 .
The first week , 7th to 14th November , was spent entirely on preparation and getting materid ready .
The actual work on trap setting started on the 15th November .
One whole day was spent in setting the framework with ropes , anchors and floats .
The work on setting .
the net and wing was completed during the second day , 16th November .
Because the bottom was sandy and the current strong the anchor ropes began showing signs of loosening in the very next day after the trap was set , and the shape of the trap became distorted .
On 20th November , the condition of the trap was very poor .
Some of the anchors became loose and entangled with the net .
The catch was taken out and the trap dismantled and removed .
A large amount of sea-weed and other floating material was caught in the net , making it very heavy and dificu !
t to operate .
The net was broken in several , places , believed to be damage caused by sharks .
The catch from this experiment was poor 2nd consisted mostly of barracuda , rays , squids , and dorab ; msny of the surface feeders were found dead gilled in the mesh .
The poor result of this experiment was attributed to : - - - - - WINO ROPE I - - - - * NCHOR ROPE FIO .

The framework of the trap was completely set during the first day , 6th November , and the entire trap was set up during the second day .
Thirteen long wooden poles were used to strengthen the framework of the trap in addition to the usual number of anchors .
.
.
The wing net was hauled up once in every tw6 days for inspection and for removal of undesirable substance caught on it .
The fish gilled on the net were also , removed to prevent sharks ' dama , ging the net .
By doing so the condition of the net was well maintained .
The size of fish gilled and their position of the net were careful recorded .
The net was lifted on December 23rd , and i t was found to be in good condition with only some small sections of it slightly torn .

Prior to the experiment the net was treated with a lukewarm solution of coal tar and creosote mixture ( 10 % creosote in coal tar ) .
The local fishermen were not familiar with this method of net preservation and were afraid that the colour and order of the preservative might repel the fish .
However , the results of this experiment indicated that fish were not repelled by this net preservative .
The site silectcd for erection of the trap for this experiment was about 100 meters east of the site used for the previous experiment .
The framework of - the trap was laid down on 7th January , and the whole trap with netting was completely set on the next day , January 8th .
The wing used for this experiment was rneters'in length , twice as long as those used for the previous experiments .
The increase of the length of the wing showed definite increase in catch .

For 17 fishing days the total catch was 2048 kilos , giving an average catch per day of 120 kilograms .
During the same period the average catch per day for each Poh operating nearby under the same conditions , was only about 30 kilos .
I t may not be out of lace to mention here that in Japan during the peak of the fishing season a catch of 3 tons per day per Masu Ami is not uncommon .
Since the fish stock of the inshore waters of Thailand is far richer than that of Japan it is not unreasonable to expect a daily catch of over 4 tons per Masu Ami operating in waters during good fishing season .
DISCUSSION OF RESULTS These experiments represent the firsc series of trials on the operation of Masu Ami in this part of the world .
Although the season when the experiments were conducted was a poor one for trap fishing and the catch obtained was nothing exciting , yet the results are of considerable significance .
T h e ~ e xperiments indicate clearly that the Masu Arni , which is intended for fishing in calm and well protected coastal waters , requires some modification before it can be adopted to operate in localities where current is strong and bottom sandy .
With stronger anchors , possibly assisted by a few long wooden poles the net could be set firmly even where the bottom is sandy and current strong .
With more effective floats , such as those of glass , to replace the bamboo ones , the net with its bags could be held in good position for the fish to enter .
The length and mesh of che wing require some change .
By lengthening the wing , more fish could be intercepted and directed into the net .
The mesh should be changed in accordance with the size of local fish .
The amount of dead fish may possibly be reduced by removing the catch from the bag a t shorter intervals .
Net preservation is important in Masu Ami fishing .
More detailed studies on the types of preservative and technique for their application are required .
Further experiments are required for improvement of the design of the trap and technique of its operation in Thai waters before introducing it to the local fishermen .
The amount of capital investment and operational expenditures of Masu Ami and Poh and a , summary comparison regarding the advantages and disadvantages between the two kinds of traps are given below : CAPITAL COST & OPERATIONAL EXPENSES Masu Ami Capital lnvcstmcnt 27,470 Baht .

Masu Ami when set strictly according t o the Japanese method could not stand firmly against the strong current of local waters .
2 .
When a few wooden poles were employed to support the framework and heavier anchors used the trap was strong enough t o resist strong current .
3 .
By increasing the length of the wing more fish were intercepted and directed into the net .
4 .
N e t treated with creosete-coal tar mixture did not show repelling effect on fish .
5 .
The capital cost and monthly operational expenditure of a Masu Ami are less than those of a Poh of corresponding size .
6 .
Masu Ami is easier t o operate and requires less personnel than Poh .
7 .
It takes only two - days to set u p a Masu Ami , and less than one day is enough to dismantle i t .
8 .
The catch of Masu Ami consisted of more species and larger quantity than the catch of a corresponding Poh operating undet similar conditions , but some of the fish caught died inside the bag .
9 .
Masu Ami fishing requires very little o r no wooden poles .
10 .
Masu Ami with certain minor modifications can be operated in Thai waters with good results and may be introduced to replace Poh with advantages .

hTews Indonesia , June 19SO : Published by the Fisheries Research Institute , 2:66-68 Pnom-Penh , Indo-china : ( 150 > sulphur in nuoc-mam over its principal forms e.g. total , organic and inorganic compounds was studied .
The determinathn of the inorganic sulphur compounds was carried out by precipitating them as barium sulphate which only takes place quantitatively under controlled conditions .
To determine the total quantity of S the organic sulphur compounds are first mineralized .
The destruction is carried out in a Kjeldahl-flask and is attained by combining an oxidation with nitric acid and copper with an oxidation by perchloric acid .
The technique needs to be practised in order to prevent explosions .
After this the total quantity of organic sulphur compounds precipitated as barium sulphate can be determined .
The quantity of organic sulphur compounds is computed by subtracting the inorganic sulphur from the total sulphur .
I t was found , that the organic sulphur content of nuoc-mam varies from 0.54 to 1.165 g. per litre , the greatest amount usually being found in nuocmam containing the greatest amount of organic nitrogen .
Furthermore the ratio of organic nitrogen and organic sulphur was computed , and appeared to be rather variable , the extreme values being 8.6 and IT.4 ; i t is therefore not possible to deduce the quantity of organic sulpuhur from the organic nitrogen .
In nuoc-mam the quantity of inorganic S surpasses the quantity of organic S. There is no correlation between the quantity of inorganic S and the quantity of salt .
Shortly before the war some additional work was done by A. G. van Veen ( Eykman Inst .
Batavia , Java ) ( priv .
comm .
1940 ) .
Dialysis experiments have demonstrated that in nuoc-mam the proteins have indeed been digested practically 100 % .
On special request of Guillerm , van Veen carried out determinations of vitamin BI nu trace of which could be detected , and the same was the case with the other B vitamins ( B2 - - complex ) .
Many variations in the methods of nuoc-mam preparation have been reported , but they all come to the same fact , that the meat of the fish is dissolved .
The pickle contains in the beginning , therefore , essentially dissolved proteins ( biuret reaction ) .
The proteins are s !
omly decomposed and there are given off principally amino acids ( and ammonia ) .
Since the solution of the proteins and the subsequent decomposition into amino acids takes place even if the entire process is kept sterile by the use of chloroform , i t was believed that the acticn was due to enzymes .
The investigation was , therefore , directed .
towards the enzyme action and began with the study of salt free solutions ( Mesnard & Rose , 1920 ) .
A ch ~ oroform extract was prepared by hanging bruised fresh fish , wrapped in a cloth , in chloroformr vapour under low pressure .
The juice from the fish was collected for a period of 24 hours and its action on gelatine investigated .
The juice thus prepared from the meat did not liquefy the gelatine , while a chloroform extract of the organs , on the other hand , proved to be highly active upon gelatine but this action did not continue long .
For that reason a preparation was sought that wouId be more persistently active .
To this end gIycerine extracts were prepared as follows : The fish was bruised and mixed with an equal weight of gIycerine without the addition of salt , and after standing for 48 hours at 30 degrees C , was filtered .
This glycerine extract was less active than the chloroform extract , but remained active longer , and was therefore more suitable for further investigation .
The action of these extracts on the following substances was studied : gelatine ( liquefaction ) .
coagulated eggwhite ( clarification and solution ) .
peptone ( disappearance of biuret reaction and increase of amino-acids-form01 titration ) .
In these experiments the salt free extracts were preserved from putrefaction by totuol .
The results were as follows .

Thus only the juices of the organs are able to decompose the proteins from tke beginning , while those prepared from the meat were only active when decomposition had already begun ; the latter being ab !
e to decompose the intermediate products such as peptone .
The fish ~ i c k l e is not the active agent , since most of the process cakes place in the body of the fish .
The principal function of the pickle is to hold the decomposition products in solution and to retard the growth of the aerobic bacteria .
Thus the juices of the organs prove to be the most important solvent in the preparation of the nuoc-mam and for that reason a further study was made of the g !
ycerine extract of these organs .
Thc cptimum temperature for the action on gelatine proves to lie between 36 `` and 44 degrees C. Furthermore , i t was foundathat the glycerine extract was active exclusively in a neutral or alkaline medium .
A weak acid reaction hinders the digestion of coagulated egg-white very markedly and less amino acids are formed .
- Salt also slows up the enzyme action .
20 % of salt ( NaCl ) reduced the activity of the enzyme to one third .
A nuoc-mam of good quality contains from 20 to 25 % of salt .
If a specimen contains Icss salt the enzymes can react better , but unless some disinfecting medium is used the aerobic bacteria multiply so rapidly that putrefactive action predominates .
Keeping fioperties .
As we have seen above , Rosd has stated as a criterion of good nuoc-mam that the amount of formoltitratab !
e nitrogen should amount to at least half of the total nitrogen .
Should a nuoc-mam contain less amino acids i t is unstable because of the ammonia formed , which may occur even when the product is sterile .
TIGs criterion of Rose appears indeed to be a guarantee of durability .
The amino acids themselves act as preservatives , a fact that is clearly shown in the case of the condensed , salt free '' nuoc-mam `` prepared in the laboratory under sterile conditions , and reduced to one quarter of its original volume ( Guillerm , 1928 , p. 39 ) .
This liquid may be kept for an almost indefinite time , which is ascribed to a high content of amino acids .
A low ammoniaamino acid ratio in the solution procures an acid reaction .
The durabiIity of commercial nuoc-mam also coincides with an acid reaction ( low pH ) .
Good nuoc-mam diluted with distilled water in the proportion of 1 to 10 or 20 , should give a clear yellow colour with phenoIred .
If there is a tinge of red , i t cannot be kept for long without undergoing putrefaction .
As we have seen above , in North Annam tinh is added to the nuoc-mam and sometimes molasses or maize which has first been boiled and then roasted ( RosB , 19 1 8 a & c ; Gui !
lerm , 192 8 ) .
This serves amongst other things to render the colour of the pcorer qualities ssaewhat darker when the leaching has been carried too far ; but it also seems to have a certain preservative action , possibly because thcarbohydrates of thc tinh , maize or molasses are con ~ e r t e d to acids by bacterial action .
In addition , the use of several roasted ingredients suggests a bactericidal activity of caramelised carbohydrates .
A t any race i t appears that by these additions i t is possible to economize in the use of salt in the case of nuocmam that is so unstable and alkaline that even saturation with salt would not stop putrefaction .
In some instances i t appears possible that a ratio of 1 part of salt by weight to ten parts of fish is s d c i e n t .
In some regions the addition of tinh is supplemented by another process .
Thtee or four days after the first salting the pickle is drained off , boiled and again poured over the fish ( RosC , 1918 c ) .
In the publication describing this method it was regarded as a primitive attempt at sterilisation .
This comparative !
^ rough and ready process can , however , have no real significance in that direction and its true purpose is still obscure .
Nitrogen partition in solid condiments .
In connection with the investigations on nuocmam , some work has also been done on the solid condiments , pra-hoc , pa-dec and mam-tom .
These pastes have a soluble and an insoluble content .
The solub !
e fraction consists of the digested flesh , and of the mineral salts , nearly all of which originate from the sea .
The insoluble fraction consists of the unaltered parts of the flesh and of insoluble salts .
When dissolved in water , the solub !
e fraction gives a solution , which closely resembles nuoc-mam , wen the partition of the nitrogen compounds , but the ammonia nitrogen sometimes predominates over the amino acid nitrogen especially in older samples .
Based on the analysis of a few samples , Brkmond and Rosed ( 1 9 18 , 19 19 ) give the following limits for the three condiments : moisture 52-63 % soluble fraction 26-30 % insoluble fraction 8-17 % In describing the partition of the nitrogen within the soluble fraction , the authors give the following data computed in percent of total soluble nitrogen .

10 Estimation of qualityi The quality of fish oil depends almost entirely on the water content .
' In practice this is roughly estimated by burning a rag which has been dipped into the oil , as alieady described ( Finelle , 1923 ) .
Attempts have been made to carry out more exact determinations , but considerable difficulty was experienced in taking random samples , since the water quickly accumulates on the bottom of the containers , even after a thorough stirring of the oil .
Some inconvenience was also caused by an increase of weight of the samples stored in a stove at 10S degrees C , which was due to oxidation .
The water-content of uncontaminated samples ranges from 0 to 2 % % .
Oil containing more moisture may be regarded as contaminated .
Chemical methods and results .
The investigation of fish oil , especially that made from Dorosoma nasus Bloch .
was subsequently taken in hand by Marcelet ( 1928 , a , 1929 ) .
In respect of the possibilities of technical applications of the oil its physical properties were examined .
The chemical invesGgation was initiated with some preliminary test .
Acidity , indicating the content of free acids in % weight .
An oil sample of 100 g. was dissolved in 10 cc .
chloroform and 10 cc .
neutralised alcohol 95 % , containing some phenolpthalein .
Titration was carried out in the ordinary way with a standardized NaOH solution .
The acidity ranges from 2 % to 1276 or still more according to age .
This index may be regarded as a measure of preservation ; the purer the oil , the better its keeping properties and the lower its acidity .
The dark-coloured oil , obtained as a by-product in the nuoc-mam manufacture , contains much more free acid than the cooked samples .
Iodine index ( after Vijs ) .
This index indicates the amQunt of iodine % of weight that can rbi fixed to the ' fatty substances .
The determination is taken as a measure of .
the amount of unsaturated constituents .
The results were similar to those obtained with other fish oi !
s. Saponification index , indicating the amount of KOH that can be bound to free or esterified fatty acids .
The tested samples appeared to contain only small amounts of unsaponifiable matter , ranging from 2 to 3S ;/c , which is similar to the constitution of other fish oils .
Fattv acids .
With the techniaue of the lead salts , the unsaturated fatty acids were separated from ihe saturated .
The saturated acids were separated into several fractions by means of repeated crystallisation after being dissolved in hot alcohol .
In this investigation i t was found , that the oil from Dorosoma nasus may contain considerable amounts of unsaturated fatty acids .
The bulk of the saturated material had a melting point of 55 degrees C and this fraction turned out to consist of an acid , not hitherto Imown , its formula being CleH &OOH; this fatty acid was termed dorosomic acid .
Another fraction had its melting point a t 62.5 OC corresponding to palmetic acid , and still another at 69.5 '' C corresponding to stearic acid .
In small , quantities , still other fractions were isolated , containing unknown acids .
In later years , the grease of Ca-linh-banh ( Thynnichthys thynnoides Bleeker ) , and some other fresh water fish from Cambodia , has been investigated along similar lines ( Marcelet , 1940 ) .
Dorosomic acid was again detected .
Prosjmts for technical use .
Possibilities of industrial application have been investigated by Marcelet ( 1928 , b ; 1929 ; 1940 ) .
The low content of unsaponifiable matter of the Ca-moi oil yields a product of high utility vaiue in soap manufacture .
I t has great drying properties and this makes i t valuab !
e as a replacement of linseed oil as the vehicle in paint .
It gives satisfactory results in the treatment of leather .
Hydrogenation deodorises the oil easily , and fixes i t into a fat suitable for cooking purposes .
Trials have been made to use the product as fuel in diesel motors .
In Europe the viscosity caused some inconvenience but later experiments made in the country gave satisfactory results , the tropical temperature making i t more fluid .
Although the petroleum .
oils are much cheaper than the oils of fish , i t is interesting to note this result in a region such as , Indochina which has no natural Source of petroleum .
Similar possibilities of technical use have been established for the grease of Ca-linh-banh .
A cracking procedure has been applied in the Ca-moi oil experiments in order to obtain substitutes for petro !
eum derivates ( Chevey , 1934 ) .
One trial yielded 2 5 ' ; benzene 5 5 gas-oil 1 5 96 lubricating oil 5 C / c loss SECTION 111 .

The French government of Indochina was seeking methods of preparing fish quickly and economically which might offer the country products for exportation .
Although no success has been attained in building up a profitable industry , the attempts are interesting in connection with the above mentioned investigations because several of the native methods of preparing fish were taken as a guide and the investigations have contributed towards extension of the knowledge of the subject .
Fish oil .
The first attempt to modernize the fisheries industries included the manufacture of fish oil .
I t was hoped to double the Cambodia fish oil production by a suitable application of modern principles , since by modern procedure twice as much 011 might be extracted from the same fish waste as by eh : old Cambodian methods .
Only a small amount of the fish waste of the Great Laire is ut ~ ilzcd by the natives , and this circumstance seemed to offer possibilities of increasing production .
The `` Socibt6 du Grand Lac '' tried to operate a floating plant on the lakes ( Krempf , 1927 , p. 20 ) .
In the procedure adopted the freeing of fatty substances was effected by direct contact of steam with the fish enclosed in large autoclaves .
The steamed fish was then transferred from the autoclaves into a continuous press in order to separate the solid masses from the liquid portion , that is the water content and the oil .
Unexpected difticulties were encountered in the separation of the oil from the water , a persistent emulsion hindering the manufacture .
On examination , one of the causes of this failure p r o ~ e d to be the emulsifying property of the contents of the intestinal tract of mud eating fish of the lakes used for the preparation .
Although the method had previously given quite satisfactory results in Europe for the reduction of herring oil , this and any other wet procedure is doomed to failure applied on the lakes of Cambodia .
For this reason possibilities here were restricted to methods involving an initial drying or the hsh ; separation of the oil was then carried out by pressure at a temperature of 80 degrees C. and a subsequent aln ~ ost complete chemical extraction by trichlorc-ethylene or other solvents that could be easily rcgaintd .
The steam-heated driet mas provided with a ccntral shaft , to which stirrer blades were fixed .
The fish waste was dried and at the same time pulverised by the combined action of heat and mechanical agitation , the intestines being transformed into a blackish powder from which the oil could be extracted at any time afterwards .
Fish meal .
When the whole fresh fat fish is used , a 3 hour treatment by the method described above ytelds a white mass , occasionally containing 40 to 50 % of fat .
Since the product contains only 10 % moisture , it may be stored for a considerable lengtn or tlme , lr properly protected against mites and insects .
In order to prevent the fatty substances becoming rancid , limited contact with the air is recommended .
After extraction of the oil and suitable refinement of the stock , a fish meal remains which is suitable for human consumption , and is not to be regarded as a waste product .
Thus the primary interest was diverted from the oil and centered on the preparation of fish meal .
In subsequent trials the meal was therefore prepared from non oily fish , the procedure being simpler without fat extraction .
Before processing , the fish were usually cut in two oblique longitudinal sections so that one part consisted of the head and viscera and the other of the musculature of the back and the tail ( Krempf , 1925 , 1934 ) .
The head and viscera were kept apart for other use , and only the fleshy parts were worked up to fish meal .
Autolysate .
As a supplement to the above work , an egort was made to develop a method of preparing autolysate in which the solvent acticn of the juices from the viscera should be more intensive than in the nuocmam procedure , so that the preparation time should thereby be shortened .
Since it has been demonstrated that the autolytic action of the enzymes was reduced to one third by the customary quantitjl of salt , attempts were made to replace the salt by some other anti-putref active substance .
This might have brought with i t the advantage that the product could be used as a principal article of diet , which is not the case with the original nuoc-mam because of its high salt content ( Krempf , 1925 , p. 14 ) .
The first experiments were made with chloroform , but later nitrochloroform ( = `` chloropicrin '' CCIsN02 ) was chosen as being more suitable .
Since this is one of the most active military gases , great care must be taken in making such experiments .
The authors claim to hare been able to obtain complete sterilisation by the application of nitrochloroform without hindering autolysis in any way .
The volatility of the preservative had the advantage that it could be driven of pound readily by evaporating under low pressure , as soon as its presence was no longer required ( Kremif , bravet & invention 5 7 1.1 18 ) .
The head and viscera were kept separate from the fish meal preparation , then ground and left to autolyse as they would with 2 to 3 ' 1 0 ~ of nitrochloroform .
In this manner as much protein was d i - solved in five days as required months in the native process .
After two weeks the solution contained 1 % times as much autolysed products as good nuoc-mam that conforms to the legal requirements ( Boez & Guillerm , 1930 , b , p. 1056 , c , p. 20 ) .
The autolysate was then concentrated in vacuo a t a low tempeperature , which drove out the dangerous preservative .
When the volume had been reduced to one quarter of its orlginal amount the product is protected by its own amino acid content from further disintegration and is therefore durable ( Guillerm , 1928 , p. 39 ) .
The autolysate obtained by this sterile process , as welt as the hsh meal prepared by the heat method , have not been well rece ~ ved by the natives , in spite of the original high expectations .
The excellent food value was demonstrated by several tests made in garrisons , hospitals and on estates , but where the choice of food was left free , the powerfuliy penetratmg fishy odour that is typical of the native fish product , proved clearly enough to be more ecceptable .
B. Bacteriology General remarh .
The failure to find local markets gave impetus to fresh investigations which showed that the characteristic d o u r so desired by natives was caused by the action of bacteria .
In the native preparation of nuoc-mam and pra-hoc from the second day there develops a homogeneous flora of an anaerobic spore former , especially in the fleshy parts of the fish , before a considerable quantity of salt has penetrated .
Pickle and viscera , on the other hand , appear to offer no suitable medium for the development of this organism .
Isolation of this spore forming organism was rendered somewhat difficult by its anaerobic properties , so that former attempts had remained unsuccessful ( Denier , 19 1 5 ) .
This must have been one of the reasons that no thought was given for so long to anything except enzyme action .
The characteristics of this organism were further studied , but unfortunately not according to the American methods , so that insertion in Bergy 's system , which has obtained international validity , is not yet possible .
The diagnosis as given by the authors runs as foliows ( BoGz & Guillerm , 1930 , a e ( c ) : Diagnosis of new Clostridium .
Anaerobic rods , Gram positive , sporulating in S days in Veillon solution .
Spores oval , subterminal , resistant to 5 minutes a t 80GC , but killed within 30 minutes , at the same temperature .
O n Veillon-agar colonies appearing within 24 hours , attaining 2 to 3 mrn .

This diagnosis enables us - to recognise the organism as a Clostridium .
Culture media .
Dr. Guillerm kindly procured me the recipes after which he prepared his Martin 's and Veillon 's culture media .

Picking up the colonies is done with a narrow pipette .
Bacterial metabolism .
The proteolytic action of this newly found Clostridium , has been investigated more closely because of its bearing on the nuoc-mam manufacture .
Proteolvsis was therefore tested on sterilised hsh meat in an equal volume of water under a vaseline layer .
Though the published data of this investigation are rather scanty , the authors arrive at the conclusion that , so far as the formation of formal titratable nitrogen is concerned , there is no essential difference between bacterial action and the digestion by enzymes from the muscies and the intestinal tract of the fish .
Against this a marked difference seems to be exhibited in the production of volatile bases , as indicated by the proportion of nitrogen from volatile bases to form01 titratable nitrogen .
This ratio will amount to 10 % in the products of bacterial proteolysis , whereas in sterile enzymatic proteolysis , this ratio will range from 10 to 11 % .
The analysis of some 200 samples of native nuocmam has given ratios ranging from 3 1 to 60 % .
This character , together with the characteristic odour of nuoc-mam , shows that besides enzymatic dissolution , bacterial action is also instrumental in the manufacture of native nuoc-mam .
With the preparation of pra-hoc , on the other hand , bacterial action takes place in the first instance owing to the removal of the entrails ( Chevey , 193 1 ) .
Especially interesting in this connection is the preparation of nuoc-mam in the province of Cantho , in the extreme West of Cochinchina ( Chevey , 1931 , p. 29 ) .
Here the fish are first gutted and then salted , as is the case with preparation of pra-hoc ; the fish do not dissolve much , but develop the desired odour .
Pineapple juice is then added to effect the digestion of the flesh and thus nuoc-mam is obtained .
So here the age-old empiricism of the people cleverly utilizes bacterial and enzymic reactions .
C. Flavouring trials One thing and another induced the French also to include the bacteria in their process .
After expulsion of the nitrochloroform the sterile autolysate was inoculated with the essential microbe , either in pure culture or not , and then tested occasionally for flavour .
If , after 24 to 40 hours , the liquid was saturated with salt , the product seemed to be identical with the ordinary nuoc-mam ( Krempf , 1929 ) .
The preparation of the autolysate took 4 to 5 days and the expulsion of the nitrochloroform but a few minutes so that this might indeed be called a quick process as the native preparation takes months and months ( Krempf , brevet d'invention 692.9 18 .
) The manufacture of fish meal was also altered , the stirring being carried out at moderate temperature .
The mash resulting from this treatment was still moist from its own water content .
I t was spread out in the open , and soon the desired odour developed .
A fragrant fish meal was then obtained by subsequent drying in the sun or in vacuo at a low temperature .
In order to present an unaccustomed product to the people , i t was provided in a familiar form rather than in a powder .
The fish meal-was therefore mixed with the fermented autolysate which was condensed to a syrup , and this was mixed again with tapioca flour .
The flat cheesy lumps were cut into slices , in which form i t was presented to the customers at the rate of 1 piaster per kg .
A daily ration of IOO g ; of this highly nutritive and product was considered to be an ideal supplement to the ordinary menu .
Apart from this , another experiment has been made in France , by treating meat with nuoc-mam ( Gauducheau , 1927 ) .
Different extracts have been tried to give a special flavour to the flesh , when injected imo the arterial system shortly after slaughter .
This has been practised with fowls , small game and even sheep .
When after killing the bleeding has stopped , the necks are tied off and a quantity of liquid , amounting to 1/20 of the body weight is introduced into the blood vessels by injection .
After one or two hours the meat can be dressed and will be ready for use after one or two days .
I f the treatment is carried o u t with a mixture of tomato juice and nuoc-mam , & he meat will acquire a gamy high flavour which seems t o be much desired i n French cookery .
The gamy flavour is thus obtained artificially , without the action of putrefactive organisms .

However , in none of these papers is any consideration given to productivity of estuarine systems , nor are the ecological implications of the distribution of hydrological properties in such systems discus5ed .
The examination of these aspects of estuarine hydrology on a comparative basis has been engaging the attention of C.S.I.R.O ., Fisheries Division since 1940 .
Since .
that date , periodic hydrological investigations of a number of Australian estuarine systems have been carried out ( Fig. I ) .
Within each system .
sampling has been extended into the freshwater components ; more recently bottom sampling has also been included in all surveys .
The first of a series of papers on Australian estuarine hydrology will shortly be published and will discuss in greater detail the subject matter of this symposium address .
I t is proposed , therefore , to limit this address to an illustration of some features of estuarine hydrology and of estuarine productivity by examination of a number of representative systems .
I t is necessary at this juncture to stress the difference between an estuarine and a brackish water environment .
Brackish water is generally understood to mean sea water diluted by freshwater , and need not necessarily be influenced by tidal movement ; i t forms variously brackish water lakes , lagoons and other similarly stable environments .
By an estuarine environment we mean one that is not only subject to long-term alteration in chlorinity and other properties by seascnal variations in the amount of fresh water dilution , but is also persistently under the short-term influence of tidal movement .
The use of chlorinity conflicts as a measure of this effect is postulated in this paper .
THE ESTUARINE ENVIRONMENT Definition of terms In this paper the following meaning will be assigned to certain terms ( fig .
2 ) : - ( a ) Estuarine system .
- That part of a marine inlet or river having free communication with the open sea , extending from the natural marine entrance to the limit of persistent fluviatile flow .
The estuarine system embraces both estuary and river components .
( b ) Conflict .
- In most estuarine systems and especially in certain zones , a pronounce6 tidalgenerated diurnal variation in hydrological properties occurs .
This diurnal variation has been termed the conflict .
The diurnal conflict in chlorinity is termed the chlorinity conflict and simi !
arly for other hydrological properties .

suggests a summer flooding cycle for the former and a winter flood cycle for the latter .
The Derwent River is also affected by the melting of winterspring snows on the central plateau , which often lead to a post-vernal and occasionally early summer secondary flooding of this system : I t is felt that the time of year during which flood scouring of an estuarine system occurs is of greater importance in its effect on estuarine productivity than the magnitude of such a scouring .
In a system subject to winter-spring flooding , the maximum disruption of the plankton occurs at a time when , because of runoff nutrients and vernal stimulation , potential production should be at a maximum .
In a summer flood system on the other hand , flooding occurs after the vernal plankton burst , during a period of nutrient exhaustion and plankton debilitation .
~ rov : ded post-flood recovery of such a system is rapid , the increase in nutrients should stimulate late summer production .
The effect of flood discharp on the physic ^ chemical aspects of the estuarinelenvironment is of course catastrophic .
Up to a certain discharge level which is governed by the physiographic , tidal and hydrological features of each individual estuarine system , a dynamically balanced state is established , in which freshwater intrusion is absorbed by mixing with saline waters and subsequent seaward transfer by successive mixing exchanges ( cf. Section 3 ) .
In summer , evaporation losses assist this process .
Each individual estuarine system is able to absorb a certain volume of freshwater without appreciable variation in the distribution of major hydrological properties .
The volume of this equilibrium discharge varies with each individual system , and is dependent upon local physiographic , tidal and hydrological features .
Above or below this equilibrium discharge , considerable displacement of water masses occurs and flood scouring or drought saline domination is the end result .
The return of such systems to a normal state is also governed by local features .
In general , however , the normal hydrological state is developed fairly rapidly after flood scouring , except in the atidal south-west Australian systems ( see Swan River , Section 9 ) , in which penetration of marine water masses isostatically follows the recession of fresh-water volume without the accelerating processes of absorption by marine dilution and tidal transfer seaward of the diluted marine water mass .
I t is so seldom that freshwater runofl ceases completely in south-east Australian estuaries that a reversion to a complete drought phase of distribution of hydrological properties is rare and need not be considered , apart from the normal state .
In south-west Australia , however , where complete cessation of summer runoff occurs , penetration of saline water masses occurs to an extreme degree .
3 .
MIXING EXCHANGES A N D CONFLICTS I N ESTUARINE HYDROLOGY In an estuarine system there is a continual mixing exchange between freshwater and neritic water masses .
The manner in which this mixing occurs determines to a large extent the zonal characteristics of the system .
If vertical turbulence is a slight , mixing is largely confined to surface waters with small vertical exchanges and under such conditions a definite movement of surface water seawards and a counter movement of bottom neritic waters towards the upper reaches of the system , becomes established .
This method of mixing exchange is common in the atidal systems of south - west Australia ( see Fig. 4 ) .
If , on the other hand , vertical turbulence is high , mixing exchanges result in the formation of diluted water masses , each of which is to a certain extent isolated from adjoining water masses .
Mixing , then , is largely a process of horizontal eichange across the vertical boundaries of these water masses ( see Fig. 4 ) .
Fig. 4 .
A diagram showing the circulation paths and the type of mixing boundary developed in ' A.

A typical tidal estuarine system in which a conflict could develop .
Both systems are assumed to be at a normal discharge level .
The small scale diagrams show the type of .
ClC / co distribution to be expeoted in both types of systems .
Mixing , however , is a phenomenon which takes place to the greatest extent at the dimension of water particles , or even less .
Superimposed upon the mixing exchange processes is the horizontal translatory movement of water masses developed as a result of tidal rise and fall of water level in an estuarine system .
This translatory movement influences the mixing processes by its effect on the turbulence , but only incidentally , as the mixing processes occurring in the Swan River , in the absence of tidal movement .
demonstrate .
This translatory movement of water masses sets up a persistent diurnal cycle of variatibn in hydrological properties at any fixed reference point in the system , and i t ispossible , to p a g e the intensity of this translatory movement by measuring thc diurnal variation in some convenient hydrological property .
Since chlorinity is the most satisfactory water-mass identifying property in estuarine hydrology , the diurnal variation in chlorinity has been taken as a measure of translabory motion past a fixed reference point .
This diurnal rhythm in chlorinity and other hydrological properties has wide ecological implications for fixed sessile organisms in an estuarine system .
This diurnal rhythm , therefore , has been termed the conflict and the diurnal cycle in any particular property suitably prefixed , e.g. chlorinity conflict .
It has been found that the maximum chlorinity conflict within an estuarine system occurs in the gradient zone .
Simultaneous determination of chlorinity conflicts at a number of stations in the George 's River-Botany Bay estuarine system ( see Table 1 ) clearIy establishes this point .
The enormous chlorinity conflict a t Jerseyville on the Macleay River ( see Table If is unaccompanied by a big rise and fall of water lever , whilst at Deviot on the Tamar River a large rise and fall of water level is not associated with an almost imperceptible chlorinity conflict ( see Table 1 ) .
' Rise and fall of water level a t a particular point in an estuarine system , therefore , may be a purely local phenomenon and not quantitatively indicative of translabory movement of water masses .
In an atidal estuarine system only minor mixing occurs vertically across horizontal boundaries and a marked difference in the surface and bottom diurnal cycles of hydrological properties occurs ( see Table 1 ) .
Movement of surface water seawards , in such a system , is an isostatic phenomenon and takes place as successive energy thresholds are established .
Such a threshold was apparently established at Fremantle Bridge at about 7 p.m. during the period of observation .
The factors considered operative in the development of conflicts are depicted in Fig. 3 .
In all mixing processes the effect of wind stirring must be considered as well as thermal overturning .
Since wind and thermal effects are seasonal and vary enormously in eficiency , from one estuarine system to another , they have been neglected as factors in this diagram .

ZONATION I N A N ESTUARINE SYSTEM A zonal diagram representing a hypothetical estuarine system is depicted in Fig. 2 which com - bines features from a number of systems .
This system is assumed to be at a normal discharge level of freshwater ( c f. Section 2 ) .
Such a system consists of four hydrological zones : ' M a d e Zone .
This zone consists of water masses which resemb !
e in their hydrological properties the adjoining neritic waters .
There is the same secular trend of nutrients , stability of the saline environment and magnitude of the annual temperature range .
There is an almost complete absence of a chlorinity conflict .
The bottom deposits are largely sand with ( fig .
5 ) black muds at sub-surface depths .
The depth of water is generally considerable , and there is a marked absence of the mud tidal flat and bays characteristic of regions further up the system .

Prospect Creek Ingleburn The nutrient content of the bottom deposits is lorn and the greater part of the total organic productivity seems to occur in the water rather than in the bottom substrata .
Tidal Zone .
his zone extends from the upper boundary of the marine to .
i $ e lower boundary of the adjoining gradient zone .
Although a fairly regular productivity cycle can be detected in the waters of this zone , its magnitude is considerably below that of the marine zone .
Nutrient condition , turbulence and turbidity of the rather shallow waters of this zone probably account for this difference .
The annual temperature range is much greater than that of the marine zone , whilst chlorinity conditions are stabilized at a higher level .
A chlorinity conflict is generally absent .
The bottom deposits are largely composed of black flocculent mud , containing rich amounts of nutrients and especially phosphates .
The large proportion of tidal exposed flats and bays in this zone gives i t a characteristic appearance , and the important role of tidal condition in the establishment of its special features has prompted the term tidal zone ( fig .
5 ) .
The productivity of this zone is concentrated on the surface of the mud flats , from which region plankton seeding of the overlying waters seems to occur .
Productivitv on the mud surface is largely `` * a microbiological phenomenon involving bacteria , micro-flagellates and protozoa as well as some forms Gradient Zone .
This zone represents the transition between the almost marine conditions in the tidal to the freshwater conditions in the freshwater zones .
Within this zone the maximum variations in environmental conditions occur in respect of seaward displacement by freshwater pressure , and diurnal oscillation brought about by tidal forces .
Into this zone are swept freshwater organisms , and into it migrate also euryhaline organisms as suitable environmental conditions develop .
On the whole , however , i t is lacking in a stable plankton community and its annual productivity turnover is slight and irregular .
The bottom deposits consist mainly of greyblack muds .
in the sheltered arms and the deltas a t the mouths of the small creeks debouching into the main river .
These muds are high in phosphatic nutrients but their low organic content suggests little biological utilization of these inorganic nutrient supplies .
The chlorinity conflict , as mentioned beforc , is at a maximum in this zone and , i t is felt , plays a major part in the destructim of planktonic organisms in this zone , as well as limiting the upper penetratioa of ciliary feeding sessile organisms , such as the Sydney rock cyster , Ostrea commercialis .
Freshwater Zone .
As its name implies this zone extends from the upper boundary of the gradient zone to the limits of persistent river flow .
This zone is characterized by a stable environment , although subject to large annual variations in temperature and to the scouring effect of freshwater discharge .
I t contains a fairly specialized freshwater plankton community and does not appear to have a plankton cycle of productivity such as is cncountered in its marine cwmterpart , the marine zone .
The nutrient content of the water is high in nitrates but often low in phosphates .
The bottom deposits are composed largely of coarse sand , small pebbles and even boulders , with little or no silt muds .
The nutrient content of these bottom deposits is low .
THE SILT DEPOSITION CYCLE IN RELATION TO ZONATION During the runoff cycle from the hinterland considerable quantities of fine silt and colloidal clay particles carrying adsorbed nutrients , and particularly phosphates , on their surface are generally carried down into the lower zones of an estuarine system .
As soon as the salt content of such silted waters is increased by mixing with marine waters , electrolytic flocculation of such particles occurs .
The particles then begin to sediment out of the water mass .
The rate of fall of such particles is dependent upon the viscosity of the water , size of the particles and especially the turbulence of the water .
The turbulence of the water is at a minimum in the shallow bays and inlets of the tidal and gradient zones where maximum silt deposition occurs .
The accumulation of black silted mu + in the gradient-tidal zones can therefore be largely accoilnted for by electrolytic flocculation and sedimentation .
A diagrammatic representation of these cycles is given in the lower half of fig .
2 .
An analysis of the silt load of central New South Wales estuarine waters during flood conditions demonstrates that few nutrients and especially phosphates are being transported into them by pr : sent silted waters .
The high phosphates content of the muds in certain zones of these systems must presumably , therefore , have been accumulated during the early stages of the estuary 's existence iG its present form , or have been introduced by relatively tremendous organic turnover in the overlying waters during successive marine submergence cycles .

loped fluviatile components interrupted by a weir at station 8. In the middle of the system basins scoured down to a depth of about 100 feet are found , but the average depth is much less , f rob ably not greater than 20 feet .
This system has a volume of 77 x l oG c. metres .
In general , flood scouring of the system is a rarity and rainfall incidence is spread over the year .
Table 2 gives the annual means of chlorinity and temperature for all stations in this system during 1947 in the surface and bottom waters respectively .
Between stations 1 and 4 in the surface and for all stations in the bottom waters , the chlorinity stability is evident .
From station 4 onward greater variability in the surface waters is evident but no evidence of flood scouring or persistent freshwater influence is to be seen .
Annual means and range of temperature are practically constant throughout the system .
Nutrient conditions in suface and bottom waters respectively during the same year are given in Table 2 .
In subsequent discussions on productivity attention will be focussed on the phosphate cycle .
I t is felt that as nitrate nitrogen is only one of several sources of nitrogen available to the phytoplankton and moreover , as Harvey 's laboratory experiments have shown , is less preferred to ammonium nitrogen by plankton cultures , its usefulnes as an index of productivity is much less than that of phosphate phosphorus .
In the surface waters the organic phosphates are consistently higher than the inorganic ~ hosphates with little zonal differentiation .
.
In the bottom waters the amounts of inorganic and organic phosphates are greater than for the surface waters but equal in magnitude .
There is also a considerable reduction in the average oxygen content of the deep compared with the surface waters of tbis system .
A consideration of the seasonal cycles of properties at station 4 Port Hacking during 1946-48 ( Table 3 ( 1 ) ) gives an explanation of this differentiation .
The low oxygen content of the bottom waters is brought about by de-oxygenation cycles during the summer-autumn periods .
.
Surface values during these periods appear to be above saturation .
The de-oxygenation cycles appear to be closely linked with rather tremendous turnover of phosphates in the bottom waters .
That this is an in situ turnover is fairly clearly shown by the alternation of organic and inorganic peaks .
Although similar peaks can be discerned in surface waters the turnover is considerably reduced .
If we assume that in si t % phosphate turnover is governed by plankton activity , then rather continuous plankton turnover appears to be general in Port Hacking waters from early summer to late autumn .
Throughout this system the bottom deposits contain considerable quantities of total phosphates .
A maximum of adsorbed phosphates towards the freshwater end of the system ( Table 2 ) is correlated with a similar maximum of organic carbon and total nitrogen ( Table 2 ) .
In a marine dominated system and in the marine zone of most systems investigated this seasonal turnover of phosphates is typical .
Plankton production of the neritic type appears to be a feature of this zone .
Detrital contribution to the bottom deposits appears to be the chief factor responsible for the high total phosphate carbonnitrogen content of the deposits in a marine dominated system .
No data are available as yet for assessing the rate of transfer of nutrients from the bottom deposits to the overlying water but the sandy nature of such deposits renders it likely that such exchanges do take place fairly readily .
HAWKESBURY RIVER AS AN EXAMPLE OF A GRADIENT-DOMINATED SYSTEM The Hawkesbury River system is of considerable magnitude ( fig .
7 ) .
It is navigable up to 75 miles from the mouth and has very extensive fluviatile components draining an area of some 1,800 sq .
miles .
Around the ' mouth and especially in the big inlets off the lower reaches depths of water down to 60 feet are common .
The volume of the system to the head of navigation at station 2 1 is 710 x 10 '' C. metres .
Although severe flooding can occur in this system because of its extensive drainage area , the system appears to be able to absorb by dilution w i t h ~ u t appreciable - - zonation displacement , all but Fig. 7 .

major flood discharges .
Even then there is very seldom a disruption of the zonation but only n seaward displacement with post-flood recovery very rapid .
Table 4 gives the mean distribution of surface and bottom chlorinity and temperature in this system during 1946 .
The absence of anv marine or tidal zone except perhaps during the sukuner period is indicated Ly the chlorinitv distribution .
The dominance of the system by a gradient zone extending from near the mouth to some 50 miles upstream is also quite clear .
The correspondence between mean curves for surface and bottom waters is indicative of the strength of vertical mixing in this system .
The divergence of the annual temperature range , proceeding upstream , and the stability of the mean are characteristic of most estuarine systems .
The nutrient conditions for 1946 also are given in Table 4 .
In the surface and bottom waters there is a persistent decrease in the average content of inorganic phosphates to be correlated with the phosphate lack of the hinterland soils of this system .
An increase in the organic phosphate figure is probably an effect of insoluble silt-borne inorganic , rrther than organic phosphate .
A gradual decline in the surface oxygen content to a minimum in the mid gradient zone is probably an e % ect of persistent oxygen demand by plankton decomposition in this zone .
In the bottom waters extensive de-oxygenation , such as occurs in the Port Hacking system , is absent .
The high average content of nitrate nitrogen in this system is an effect of persistent freshwater inflow .
At station 1 ( Table 3 ( 2 ) ) , the oxygen content has never fallen below a figure of about 8 % saturation in the period 1946-48 .
During the same eriod ( Table 3 ( 2 ) ) the phosphate turnover is much E ss than for the Port Hacking system , but i t is clear that it is an in situ hen omen on and moreover , appears to be equally well developed in surface as well as bottom waters .
The total phosphate content of the bottom deposits of this system ( Table 4 ) is not very high except in the upper freshwater zone .
In the silted lower portion of the gradient zone , the adsorbed phosphate content reaches a maximum of about the same concentration as in Port Hacking .
The carbon and nitrogen content ( Table 4 ) of the bottom deposits varies with the total phosphates , but is comparatively low especially in the marine end of the system .
It appears , therefore , that in an estuarine system subject to gradient zone domination environmental characteristics and in particular turbulence and nutrient poverty prevent plankton production of the marine type , and moreover , hinder the potential production of the microbiota of the bottom deposits of the type that occurs in a system such as George 's River-Botany Bay ( fig .
2 8) , where productivity of the mud enables extensive oyster cultivation to be practised in the tidal zone .
RICHMOND RIVER AS AN EXAMPLE OF A SUMMER FLOOD FRESHWATER-DOMINATED SYSTEM The Richmond River ( fig .
8) is a broad but relatively shallow river , navigable for some 10-20 miles from the mouth .
The river is some 120 miles in length .
No extensive development of sheltered and muddy-bottomed inlets and bays is found except in the immediate vicinity of the mouth .
The chlorinity-temperature conditions in this system are given in TabIe T.
The distribution in Table y ( 1 ) was encountered immediately after a severe flood discharge .
I t is apparent that the recovery rate of this system to a normal distribution shown in Table 5 ( 3 ) is rapid and that the latter distribution is normal for the greater part of the year Fig. 8. Map showing the location of the sampling stations in the Richmond River system .
The steepness of the chlorinity gradient combined with the length of the freshwater zone shows the extent of freshwater domination .
The nutrient runoff , and particularly phosphates , is very high in this system ( Table 5 ( 3 ) ) .
Even during minimal discharge , a considerable ; quantity of inorganic phosphates is still present ( Table 5 ( 1 ) ) .
This phosphate richness is to be attributed to the exceptionally high phosphate content of the hinterland soils in this area .
The low organic phosphate content and the sub-saturation oxygen values suggest that little planktonic utilization of these nutrients occurs during normal discharge .
The phosphate richness of the waters of this system is reflected in the high adsorbed phosphate content of the bottom deposits ( Table 5 ( 2 ) ) .
These adsorbed phosphates are associated with the silted bottom deposits of the lower freshwater zone .
The organic carbon and nitrogen content of these muds is , however , very low and is probably due to lack of micro-biological fixation consequent upon the severity of annual flooding and the freshwater domination of the potentially productive muds .
In this freshwater dominated system , although large quantities of phosphatic nutrients are persistently available , the obliteration of the marine and tidal zones does not permit of the establishment of a plankton community of the type found in Port Hacking .
The steepness and therefore sensitivity of the gradient zone to variations in the tremendous volume of freshwater above it , precludes the establishment of a smaller specialized plankton community of the type found in the gradient zone of the Hawkesbury River .
The persistent annual scouring and the freshwater domination prevents the establishment of a semi marine micro-plankton community of the type associated with the mud flats in the tidal zone of the George 's River .
A freshwater dominated system , therefore , is unable to utilize to anything like maximum capacity the continous supply of inorganic nutrients contributed by runoff .
I t is considered , therefore , to possess a high potential but low actual plankton productivity .
This is reflected in the low organic phosphate content of the water and the low carbon nitrogen content of the bottom deposits .
SWAN RIVER AS AN EXAMPLE OF AN ATIDAL ESTUARINE SYSTEM The Swan River system ( fig .
9 ) has a total length of about 40 miles to station 14 and another 60 miles to the headwaters of the Avon River tributary .
In the lower portion a deep basin with depths of 40-60 feet extends from about station 6 to 4 .
The remainder of the system is predominantly shallow , with depths of less than 10 feet .
The drainage area of the Avon and Canning Rivers is about 1 , lOQ sq .
miles .
tration solely under the influence of an isostatic head in the Canning and Avon Rivers .
The extreme variation from the summer drought to winter flood conditions and the penetration of saline conditions to the upper Swan Stations are effects of the almost complete summer cessation of river flow and the concentrated discharge in late winter-early spring .
The relative isolation of the bottom waters occupying the basin berween stations 3 and 5 can be seen from the distribution of chlorinity and temperature in Table 6 .
There is a considerable discharge of phosphates into this system , as can be seen by reference to Table 6 .
The persistent decline in the surface oxygen tension proceeding upstream , and the de-oxygenation of the bottom waters of the basin in thc lower reaches are of importance in the assessment of productivity .
The seasonal alternation from winter flood to summer drought environmental conditions is given in Table 3 ( 3 ) .
The relative stability of the bottom waters is to be noted .
The corresponding cycle of nutrients , Table 3 ( 3 ) shows clearly that in spite of freshwater influx of nutrients , little local fixation and turnover occur in the environmentally stable summer period .
In the bottom cieposits of this system there is a marked peak of adsorbed ~ hosphates at station 9 ( Table 6 ) which is probably associated with a similar ~ e a k in ~ h o s ~ h a t e s of the bverlying water a t this point .
The persistent decline in total phosphates is paralleled by a similar trend in total nitrogen and to a less extend by organic carbon .
I t is considered likely that in view of the environmental instability of the surface waters and their nutrient summer depletion , such productivity as occurs in the Swan River system is mainly confined to the bottom waters and especially bottom deposits .
Insufhient data are available for comparison with bottom productivity of eastern Australian systems but it is probable that the high nitrogen and organic carbon content of the Swan River muds is bound up with considerable biological activity .
TROPHIC DIAGRAM FOR ESTUARIN_E SYSTEMS From a consideration of the estuarine data collected by C.S.I.R.O .
Division of Fisheries , the following flow diagram of factors responsib !
e for the determination of its trophic level in an estuarine system has been constructed ( fig .
10 ) .
A good deal of simplification has necessarily to be practised in the construction of such a diagram but the following groupings can be followed : - Nutrient content of bottom deposits .
- The rainfall regime acting upon the hinterland soils to a large extent determines the quantity and nutrient quality of the bottom deposits .
The disposition of such deposits is a function of local tidal and physiographical features .
The micro-biological activity in the environmentally suitable regions of such deposits contributes to the productivity of certain systems , and in some cases , i t is felt , provides a nursery ground for micro-planktonic organisms of the overlying water mass .
Nutrient content of water masses .
- The nitrogen and phosphatic compounds , together with trace elements and possibly soil enzyme systems , are a direct contribution of runoff .
The successful fixation and retention of such elements in the estuarine system depends upon the quality and quantity of the plankton and benthic fauna and flora .
The quantity and quality of plankton organisms especially are dependent upon the persistence of a suitable environment , both in respect of zonal buffering and short-term conflicts .
There appears to be a linkage between plankton production in the water mass and the fixation of detrital matter in the corresponding bottom deposit .
11 .
PLANKTON IN RELATION TO THE HYDROLOGICAL ZONES The volume of the rainfall , together with the bathymetric and tidHl characteristics of the system , determine the relative development of each of the four hydrological zones .
Productivity of an estuarine system is largely determined by the relative environmental stability of these zones .
The marine zone has maximum stability and productivity therein follows the neritic plankton cycle .
The tidal zone , because of its shallow depths , turbulence and turbidity , does not favour neritic plankton production .
Productivity therein is largely governed by microbiological activity on the surface of the nutrient-rich mud substrate .
In the gradient zone , establishment of a specialised plankton population is possible in some systems , e g. Hawkesbury River , but not in others , e.g. Richmond River .
In the freshwater zone , establishment of a specialized biological population able to withstand the effects of persistent flow and rocky substrate occurs .

Kesava Panilckar `` INTRODUCTION It is fairly well ciated with estuaries known that animal life assois highly developed so as to form a specialised fauna under tropical conditions .
In the continent of Asia , this fauna includes a large variety of species , often occurring in large numbers in the various subdivisions of the estuarine habitat .
The concensus of opinion is that this fauna does not attain the same high development in temperate waters even though there are the examples of fauna associated with low salinites as found in the B ~ l t i c Sea .
Similar groups of organisms probably exist in other continents as well , associated with the openings of large rivers into the sea or with lakes having permanent or temporary connections with the sea , contributing to areas of high biological productivity .
The fauna associated with the estuarine habitat has bzen investigated by a great many workers in India ( vide Annandale et .
al ., 191 5-1924 ; Sewell , 1334 and Panikkar & Aiyar , 1937 for fists of animals and literature ) and it is possible to say that the faunal elements are fairly well understood at the present day , although the subdivisions of this fauna on the basis of salinity distributions as demarcated by Redeke ( 1922 ) and the physiological behaviour of the species are not known .
Only in comparatively recent times had the interest in this fauna in relation to exact environmental conditions and to the of the species concerned come to the forefront of faunistic and ecological studies .
PHYSICAL FEATURES OF ESTUARINE HABITAT For the purpose of assessing the factors in the light of adaptation to estuarine conditions the scope of the estuarine habitat need not be confined to estuaries themselves but could be enlarged considerably to include , ( 1 ) the estuaries proper associated with rivers opening into the sea and where , by the influx of large volumes of fresh water into the sea , a zone of low salinity is created , the extent of this zone varying according to the size .

APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF FISH CULTURE TO ESTUARINE CONDITIONS IN SINGAPORE too , but replaced by species which have the same external appearance .
They belong however to another genus , new to science .
Kurtzcs indicus is replaced by Kurtus gulliveri Casteln .
Gobioides species are common , though the species are not always the same as on the Sunda shelf .
Thus far , this estuarine fauna is very imperfectly known and a big source of new things are still open here to the ichthyologist , I think that an estuarine fauna will be found elsewhere in the tropics on other continents too .
Nothing is known hereover thus far .
Let us hope that within a short time this will no longer be so .
Opisthopterus and Raconda seem to be lacking too , but replaced by species which have the same external appearance .
They belong however to another genus , new to science .
Kurtzcs indicus is replaced by Kurtus gulliveri Casteln .
Gobioides species are common , though the species are not always the same as on the Sunda shelf .
Thus far , this estuarine fauna is very imperfectly known and a big source of new things are still open here to the ichthyologist , I think that an estuarine fauna will be found elsewhere in the tropics on other continents too .

4 APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF FISH CULTURE TO ESTUARINE CONDITIONS IN SINGAPORE by D. W. Le Mare :> The term fish-culture in this paper will be confined to the production of fish as a staple human food ; the production of fish for sport , aesthetic pursuits or luxuries is outside present consideration .
Regarded in this sense then , the principles of fishculture have implications under two headings , Biological and Economic .
They may be enumerated as follows : The first , I consider to be the slogan for fish-culture .
1 .
Conserve fertility in the pond .
2 .
Utilise fast growing species .
3 .
Utilise species which breed readily .
4 .
Food supplies must be cheap and readily available .
5 .
Utilise fish which are acceptable to the consumer .
6 .
Select land which is suitable .
The estuarine conditions with which we are concerned to apply the above principles , are variations in salinity , rise and fail of tide and the supply of nutrient salts from the land mass through which the river runs , the estuary of which is under considera tion .
We are all familiar with the pond culture systems of Java and the Philippines for `` ikan bandeng '' or `` bangos '' Chanos chanos ; the traditional methods of fish culturz by Chinese pond owners either as pond systems or as part of small holdings are well known ; Carp culture in Central Europe and by the Jews in Palestine has been well described , however , in each method there are practical diGcu1ties to be overcome which make their further development costly .
In the Chanos cultivation there is the difficulty of maintaining a high yield of fish to the acre , year after year , for while the fish is fast growing when adequate crops of the algae on which it feeds are available ; after a number of fish harvests the yield to the acre is known to drop .
Chanos chanos is a selective feeder , and pnless its specific di : t is available it will not thrive .
For the Chinese pond systems , the yield is maintained perennially by both intensive fertilisation of the ponds with pigdung or nightsoil and by feeding the fish with vegetable crops , grass , tapioca leaves , yam leaves , etc. the former must be purchased and the latter demand that land additional to the land occupied by the pond be put under cultivation .
This demands both man-power and additional agricultural fertilizer , consequently the real yield of fish per acre as practised by the Chinese in their carp culture in Singapore , for instance .
should tnke into account the land utilised for growing the food crops .
The same arguments apply to the pond culture methods adopted in Europ :, where , for instance municipal sewage is used , as in Munich .
involving transport charges and in the use of soya beans or lupins requiring farms .
The most important substances which must be conserved are lime , phosphorous , potassium , and nitrogen , and , although we know ~ ompar ~ t ively little about their influence as yet , certain elements in minimal or trace quantities , e.g. copper , strontium .
In a !
l kncwn methods cf fish-culture , the importance of lime lies in its abiiity to change certain properties of bottom soils and to act as a buffer in the presence of all acids .
Categorically it can be said thac a weekly alkaline reacticn has been found most productive in fish ponds and that very acid waters are undesirable .
Apart from a direct effect on fish , acidity impedes the recirculaticn cf nutrients by reducing the rate of decompssition anc !
by inhibiting nitrogen fixation .

( 180 1 The calcium in lime will displace certain other fertilizing substances from organic colloidal solution consequently making them more readily avai !
able , c.g .
Potassium , and phosphate .
Because 3f its acid buffering capacity , lime increases the ability af war - * r to hold carbon dioxide thus aiding the respiraticn of the aquatic flora .
Calcium is essential for the growth of bone and while a necessary minimum concentration is essential the impeclence of gowth of fish in relation to calcium lack is not , so far as I am aware , fully determined .
The Chinese use lime as a disinfectant to kill harmful parasites and predators , quicklime , being dug into the bottom of a pond when it is being prepared for stocking .
The subsequent utiiisation of the slaked lime in the pond is of particular importance in the bottom soil .
Potassium ; optimum concentrations of this element are unknown .
Howevgr , it is readily absorbed by plant tissues and is particu !
arly effective in stimulating the growth of aquatic flora .
During rapid plant growth , potassiunl from tbe water and soil is stored in the tissues to be released later when the flora dies and decomposes and is held in the bottom soil to be released later at another season .
Often the results from potassium appear to be erratic and characterized by peculiarities which are not well understood .
When potassium is able to improve the g o w t h of carp , young fish respond much more readily than do older fish .
I t may be that one of the effects of potassium is indirect , in that i t assists the formation of avai !
ab !
e ~ h o s ~ h a t e salts through releasing dilute acid .
Phosphorous is the most important elemental fertilizer .
I t is probably a limiting factor in the harvest or yield cycle ; its importance in the periodical and seasonal plankton blooming is well described by Pearsall , Harvey and others .
The use of phosphate in ~ o n d s is followed by increased yields .
I t is we !
l known that natural phosphate concentration is higher n : ar the bottom , this is largely due to local acidity , arising from decomposition of organic mate ria !
^ , in the water just above the bottom .
Nitrogen is perhaps the most elusive cf essential fertilizers .
In general , the assimilation of nitr ~ gen by the fish may be said to be but one link in a cycle of chemical transformations , in which bacteria play a larger part .
I t must be remembered that the surface of the pond is perpetually in contact with an unlimited supply of this element .
Therefore , as well as the addition of nitrogen from extraneous fertilizers , there is some degree of nitrogen fixation by both bacteria and algae , as demonstrated by De I939 and Fogg 1942 for certain genera of Cyanophycea .
The amount fixed is certainly significant , but whether a fish pond could be designed , with suitably controlled and cultured bacteria and algae to provide the system with all the nitrogen required is as yet undetermined .
Sitrcgen is essential to the formation of fish as protein ; and the whole subject of the utilization of nitrcgen , its conservation and conversion is a vast and important field for further research .
Moreover , the iniportance of and objections to inorganic nitrogen fertilizers are not yet clarified .
- An important aspect to be considered is the relation of nitrogen and carbon concentrations .
If we consider that fixation of atmospheric nitrogen will provide a significant quantity of nitrogen to 3 pond , then too the value of added organic fertilizers , such as compost , nightsoil , cow or horse manure or municipal sewage .
also achieve special importance by virtue of their carbohydrat : content .
Nitrogen fixation by bacteria must proceed in a substrate of carbohydrate materials essential both as a source of energy , to anaerobic forms and as a constituent of bacterial protoplasm in the experimental ponds later to be described , this principle of the importance of nitrogemcarbon ratio to the formation of fish protoplasm will readily be appreciated .
Having enlarged a t some length on the first principle or slogan for the fish culturist , theypractical and theoretical implications of the other principles will now b , - considered .
A fast growing species or communities of species is most desirable for economic production .
While it is possible to utilize slow growing species and to arrange a series of ponds with harvesting arranged in cycle they will , hcwever , yield a low figure per annum Der acre and while semi luxurv varieties mav provide the fish culturist with a good cash-crop , they do not provide a staple protein for the majority of the population .
I t is , however , possible to combine both types in one pond with success , but only when the stap !
e-species breeds readily so that the culls of the staple-species when harvested are easily replaced .
In general terms it is a princip !
e that only species which breed readily , and the f ry of which may easily be obtained should be utilized .
While the now rraditional sea transport of carp fry from the West river near Canton as far as Malaya and Sarawak has been successfully achieved and of recent years has provided us with a nice experimental problem in bringing them by air , this has only been rendered possible because economically the fish have a semi luxury appeal for festive occasions and at the time of the Chinese New-Year ce !
ebrations .
The taking cf the fry cf Chanos chanos at certain seasons of the year in restricted areas on the Java coast and their subsequent transport by sea or rail has been economically possible only when labour and transport services have been cheap and the potential purchasing power of the consumer relatively high .
Unless the fry can be reared on or very close to the site of the fish-culture , the additional transport charges with handling , render the final product too expensive as a staple .
The supply of food must also be easily obtained preferably as a catch crop to a major crop or as a byproduct of a major manufacturing process , e.g. tapioca leaves , soya bean cake or rice bran .
The b Irect - biological implications of the feeding are both rl ' ly connected with the manuring of ponds and conservation of fertility and with the conversion factor of fish protein .
It is important to select not only fish-food which can easily be produced but which will give a high conversion factor for quantity of food administered to the fish when related to yield .
The carbon-nitrogen-phosphorous-ratio is important in this respect , and legumes arc satisfactory in providing this .
The human factor when considered from the point of view of consumer preference is of the utmost importance .
While as biologist and economist the fisheries worker may be able to produce a high yield of fish at low cost he must consider the palate of the consumer markets .
I t is almost a dogma that the less experienced and educated human beings are the more conservative they are in their feeding habits .
Therefore , in putting a new fish before the public as a staple , i t is essential that i t should be acceptable ; a little propaganda work properly adapted to the mental outlook of the potential consumer may not be amiss .
fic fish in estuarine conditions in Singapore and attempt to draw scmc significant biological conclusions .
The fish concerned wag a Cirhlid , Tilabia C nfossambka .
This species is indigeneous to East Africa .
Its advent to South-East Asia and specifically to Singapore during the occupation by the Japanese is a separate story .
Suffice it that when we returned to Singapore after the war this fish was established in one or two fresh-water ponds .
Now Singapore is a small island with a high population of mixed races nearly all of whom eat fish .
Due to development i t is now land-hungry and both for agricultura1 or piscicultural purposes and for houses , land is hard to come by .
Therefore in 1947 an attempt was made to investigate the potentialities of developing fish ponds in the marginal mangrove swamp at the west-end of the island with the main object of studying mullet and prawn development , incidental to the mullet and by accident , some Tilapia were admitted .
I t was soon found that this species thrived and specific experiments were started to study its cultural possibilities .
Finally sites should be selected which will fulfil certain physical as well as biological conditions .
The substratum should be of mud or clay which will hold water , sand or gravel is quite unsatisfactory .
Water supply should at least be adequate to replace loss by both evaporation and seepage ; topographically the site should be not subjected to flooding yet a t the same time should be of sufficient gradient to permit adequate draining of the ponds , foi it may be necessary for a variety of reasons other than for harvesting u , be able to drain the ponds empty .
As our Dutch friends found a t one starre in their work on Chanos `` chanos it became essential to drain the ponds as a step in Malaria-control , and I mention in passing that the development of fish-culture poses a number of problems relating to water-borne disease , malaria , filariasis and both Nematode and Platyhelminth worms .
Cansequently the closest relations should be maintained with the health authorities for while improving nutritional standards we must not increase the risk of the incidence of disease .
, Having enunciated in general terms the major principles governing fish-culture , I will describe their successful appplication to the rearing cf a speci - * Under other conditions Tilapia has been shown to have a selectii .
~ preference for certain .
- \ 1gae .
The site was selected in an area of cleared mangrove swamp on the bank of a small tidal river about one quarter of a mile from the sea .
An area of pond was cleared and the spoil used for making the bunds , the substratum was a steely-blue clay and held water well .
A sluice gate was built a t the river-side so that the pond could be filled at high tide and drained at low tide .
The maximum depth .
of the pond was four feet six inches .
A third class road ran along one side .
The area was only subjected to possible flooding a t the equinoctial tides and adequatc bunding could prevent this .
The river itself drained a semi agricultural suburb of the town of Singapore .
The Malay people who live in this area are the descendants of the original inhabitants of Singapore and are accustomed to building their houses on poles over the water .
Eight Malay houses of this type were included in the one and one-quarter acre pond .
This leads us on to the question of pond fertility as related to the species Tila1 ) ia mossnrnbica .
All the inhabitants of the houses were encouraged to t + w their household waste into the pond , particularly scraps from the kitchen .
Now this meant that a general composting of the pond was effected .
Tilapia is omnivorous , with a selective preference for planktonic crustaceans .
: ' The pond was filled at a high spring tide in February and the Tilapia a t approximately 5 cm were introduced .
The salinity of the water was 22 pnrts per thousand , the subsequent maintenance of the pond involved opening up the sluice gate a t high spring tide el-ery mouth to top up losses by evaporation and seepage .
Rain and the river maintained the salinity t 2 , of 20 parts per thousand salinity .
With the initial flooding of the pond larval Peneids and particularly larval Acetes in quantities were introduced .
These thrived ~ articularlv as a result of the household waste whici was combosting the pond and they in their turn formed a high proportion of the Tilapia food .
By maintaining the pond stagnant , apart from the monthly topping up , the fertility was conserved and the phytoplankton bloomed providing adequate food for the young Crustacean forms .
The monthly inlet of water moreover stirred up the bottom and doubtless helped to revive the distribution of ~ h o s ~ h a t e which .
while .
A the pond was lying still in the interim periods would be building up on or near the bottom .
The Tilapia grew rapidly and at the end of an e igh month period the population when analysed for all specimens above 10 cm in length showed a bi modal distribution for numbers plotted against length .
The largest fish were 36 cm in length .
There were a large number of fish under 10 cm ., however , it was clear that breeding had taken place at least twice .
One primary breeding when the initial stock reached sexual maturity which was evidenced in the clear bimodal curve .
Thereafter i t would appear that breeding became promiscuous between different generations for the remainder showed various peaks , which were not analysable simply .
However , the second and third principles which I enunciated were clearly satisfied , for the fish which were first introduced grew from a length of 5 cm .
in eight months and breeding actually occurred in the pond where culture was being effected .
The food supplies were readily available and cost nothing .
The fish is extremely '' hardy and appealed to the Indian people of whom the Tamils form quite a high percentage in Malaya because it could be offered for sale alive in tubs in the market .
I t has been accepted by the Malays readily .
Perhaps this is in part due to the advice of an elder-the State Secretary of Pahang-who on hearing that the fish came from Africa suggested that it be named Ikan Nile after the river Nile , Father of all waters .
In addition to the Tilapia which showed a yield at the rate of 1,300 Ibs .
to the acre per annum , there was an incidental catch of prawns , mullet and other small mixed fish .
This experiment has been caried out two years in succession and the principle is now being propagated in Malaya as a whole .
The conclusions to be drawn from this , are that by selecting marginal land in an estuary and putting i t under fish culture it was turned from waste land to being profitable and productive .
That by selection of Tilapia mossambica , an omnivorous euryhaline species rapid growth was achieved , a t no cost .
The facultative tolerance to variations in salinity is probably of great physiological importance .
Undoubtedly the fish grows much more rapidly and to a larger size in the brackish water than in fresh water and I believe that this is largely due to the fact that if a fish is in an isotonic solution there will be no utilization of food materials and subsequent expenditure of energy on osmoregulation .
With the run off from the land into the river there will be a number of elements brought down in trace quantities and the fish probably benefit from this .
The maintenance of the pond is minimal and there is no need for either imported food or fertilizer .
The real yield is of the order of 1,500 lbs .
of proteih to the acre per annum , at no cost other than capital outlay and maintenance and there is no foreseeable reason why it shou !
d not be perpetual .

Field studies , like those in Chesapeake Bay by Newcombe & Lang ( 1939 ) ; Newcombe , Home , & Shepherd ( 1939 ) and Newcombe & Brust ( 1940 ) , are an important approach to this problem , but results are difficult to interpret because numerous significant variables may alter simultaneously and uncontrollably .
For example , in Chesapeake Bay , phosphate values were highest in summer ; this was attributed to high turbidities reducing illumination and photosynthetic activity , but the suspended material may release phosphate to the water , or the increased phosphate may be related to the reduced oxygen concentration which was demonstrated .

Unless otherwise stated , tanks were covered with glass plates .
Phosphate determinations were made on the supernatant sea water thereby ( a ) avoiding the difficulties of determination upon the mud itself , ( b ) avoiding mechanical disturbance of the mud , ( c ) obtaining a large proportional change in sea water composition for a small change in mud composition .
Atkins ( 1923 ) original method was used with slight modification ( Stephenson , 1949 ) .
Concentrations are expressed as milligrams PnOa per cubic metre , and in general were accurate to about = k 22a though when large amounts of ferric iron were present , inaccuracies were probably higher .

No corrections were made for salt errors , and the method , though crude , ( Thompson , Bremner & Jamieson , 1932 ) was adequate for the present purposes .
Concentrations are expressed as milligrams of Fe per cubic metre and are accurate under the special conditions cf the experiment to about I 157 :. Oxygen determinations were made by the Winkler method with preliminary oxidation .
Considerable addition of KMnOr solution w : re required and this was made up in 1.5 C / c Nacl solution to prevent it from rising in the bottle and being lost on re-insertion of the stopper .

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON MUD KEPT IN AQUARIA Under the described conditions , there are noteable changes in the system , mostly caused by the mud organisms .
Initially , the water is turbid and remains so for about three days .
The mud population meanwhile regains its initial spatial relationships the animals displaced to deeper layers migrating to the surface , whilr burrcwing organisms reform their burrows .
This period of `` settling down '' is followed by a pcriod of approximately `` normal '' condidons , which ends in cne of two ways .
Using sandier muds , thr swfaces of the glass tanks are cclonised by diatoms or Enteromorpha , and the tank becomes a green walled pod .
This period of `` photosynthetic excess '' d : velops in about two months in the ( temperate ) winter and in about half this time in summer .
With black o r dark brown muds , the `` nsrmal '' per id often only lasts for two days , and is followed by a period of reduced oxygen concentration of the supernatant sea water .
The microfauna migrates from the mud into the liquid , sulphuretted hydrogen is evolved , and the fauna dies .

No corrections were made for salt errors , and the method , though crude , ( Thompson , Bremner & Jamieson , 1932 ) was adequate for the present purposes .
Concentrations are expressed as milligrams of Fe per cubic metre and are accurate under the special conditions cf the experiment to about I 157 :. Oxygen determinations were made by the Winkler method with preliminary oxidation .
Considerable addition of KMnOr solution w : re required and this was made up in 1.5 C / c Nacl solution to prevent it from rising in the bottle and being lost on re-insertion of the stopper .

( 184 resuhs ( Table 4 ) show that the microfauna releases phosphate , iron , and hydrogen ions from the mud .
The phosphate and iron values were very variable , and in similar experiments , erratic results were obtained in successive determinations .
The iron centrations greatly exceed normal values for sea water , which in turn exceed the solubility ~ r o d u c t ( Cooper , 1937 , 1948 ) .
With such large amounts of iron and phosphate mutuaI interference must occur and both will be present in colloidal and possibly particulate form .
Crude observations suggested that particdate material was present .
In all tanks the mud surface was rust coloured , and those with added microfauna , the wa : er had a noticeable brown opalescence .
Previous work had indicated the difficulties of evaluating the effects of colloids ( Stephen1949 ) , and further investigation of the present unusual conditions was not attempted .
VI .
RELEASE OF PHOSPHATE FROM POLLUTED MUDS UNDER DE-OXYGENATED CONDITITIONS Large surface and subsurface samples from the lower part of the creek ( see fig .
1 ) were each subdivided into three .
One pair of subsamples was aerated continuously with large bubbles , one pair kept lightly covered in the usual way , and the third covered with 2 cm .
of liquid parafin to minirnise oxygen entry .
Phosphate determinations were made daily and results are given in Table 5 .
These reemphasise the differences between surface and subsurface samples , and show that phosphate release also depends upon the degree of stagnation .
During this experiment , and those recorded in Table 3 , oxygen concentrations were determined for two days ( 5th and 6th Feb. ) in the period when phosphate release was commencing .
The results are given on Figure 1 where approximate rates of phosphate release are plotted against oxygen concentrations .
This figure shows that when the oxygen concentration of the water is less than about 0.7 mgm .
per litre , phosphate comes rapidly from the mud .
This effect was so spectacular , compared with the others , that subsequent work has concentrated upon this aspect .

For phosphates .
This may be due to different amounts of floccular surface material being present and it has been shown that top scrapings release more ~ hosphate than do deeper layers .
I t is also ui ~ wise to generalise on the effects of the mud fauna .
In one case , addition of animals ( Corophium ) caused a deposit which had absorbed phosphate to absorb even more .
I n another case addition of microfama caused release of phosphate ( and iron ) from mud .
These di % erenc : s may be because the burrows of Corophium oxygenate subsurface layers while the microfauna was causing chemical reduction of a thin surface layer .
This would agree with work of Einsele ( 1938 ) and Mortimer ( 194 1 , 1942 ) who str : ss the importance of the state of oxidation or reduction of this layer in fresh water conditions .
Before r h suggestior .
can be substantiated , determinations must be made of the oxidation-reduction potentials of the different microhabitats .
Phosphate is released rapidly from polluted mud when the oxygen content of the supernatant liquid is reduced .
This might explain the higher summer phosphate figures obtained by Newcombe and his collaborators as previously quoted .
Mortimer ( 15 4 1 , 1942 ) has explained the release of ~ hosphate from fresh water deposits under these conditions in terms of reduction of ferric iron in the surface layers to ferrous iron .
In the .
present conditions , low oxygen concentrations and release of phosphate were accompanied by catastrophic faunistic changes , and eventually the entire fauna was killed .
Other experiments have shown that death and enzymatic autolysis of many tissues from marine animals leads to rapid phosphate release and the who !
esale destruction of an abundant microfauna must contribute phosphate .
Bacterial protoplasm is rich in phosphorus ( Renn , 1937 ) , and bacteria occur in immense numbers in superficial layers of marine muds ( Zobell , 1946 ) .
An investigation of the mortality of these bacteria as the conditions change from oxidising to reducing , would be of great interest .
Phosphate is rapidly released from polluted muds , when the oxygen concentration reaches a low and critical value .
Additional parameters of the state of oxidation and reduction of the medium are required , and here again determinations of oxidationreduction potentials are desirable .
Further work was concentrated upon this aspect , and will be published in due course .

SUMMARY ( 1 ) When estuarine muds are kept in sea water in the laboratory , the organisms present cause marked and uncontrollable changes in conditions .
( 2 ) Phosphates are sometimes released by , and sometimes absorbed by similar samples of muds in the laboratory .
( 3 ) The presence of animais sometimes increases absorption and sometimes initiates evolution of phosphate .
( 4 ) Superficial deposits from a polluted estuary can release large amounts cf phosphate ; subsurface layers may absorb or evolve phosphate .
( Y ) Phosphate is given off rapidly from surface layers of mud when the supernatant water becomes de-oxygenated .
This may be partially due to catastrophic bio !
ogical changes .
( 6 ) Future work upon oxidation-reduction potentials of mirine deposits is indicated .

FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS Mr. Marcel LELOUP , Director of the Forestry and Forest Products Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization , representing the Director-General of the Organization , pointed out that the Forestry Division had grown out of a concern for soil conservation , and stressed the importance of the part the Sub-Commission could play in the Organization as technical adviser for the execution of the United Nations programme of Technical Assistance to the Mediterranean countries .
FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS Palais des Nations GENEVA GENERAL FAO / CEF / SCM / 32 30 May 1950 ORIGINAL : FRENCH EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON FORESTRY AND FOREST PRODUCTS MEDITERRANEAN SUB-COMMISSION SECOND SESSION Algiers , May 1950 GENERAL REPORT The Mediterranean Sub-Commission , at the invitation of the French Government , held its second session at the Hotel St. Georges , Algiers , from 8 to 13 May 1950 .
The countries represented were : FRANCE AND THE FRENCH UNION ( Metropolitan France , Algeria , Tunisia and Morocco ) , ISRAEL , ITALY , PORTUGAL , SWITZERLAND and UNITED KINGDOM .
THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION and the INTERNATIONAL UNION OF FOREST RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS were also represented .
The list of delegates is given in Annex 1 .
The session was opened by Mr. DALLIER Director of Forests for Algeria , representing the Governor-General .
He greeted the delegates on behalf of the French Government , and referred to the work carried out in Algeria by the Soil Protection and Restoration Department .
Mr. Marcel LELOUP , Director of the Forestry and Forest Products Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization , representing the Director-General of the Organization , pointed out that the Forestry Division had grown out of a concern for soil conservation , and stressed the importance of the part the Sub-Commission could play in the Organization as technical adviser for the execution of the United Nations programme of Technical Assistance to the Mediterranean countries .
The Chairman of the Sub-Commission , Professor PAVARI , outlined and reviewed the various items on the agenda , emphasising the importance of the task facing the Mediterranean forestry experts .
The Sub-Commission then turned to its agenda .
FAO / CEF / SCM / 32 Page 2 I - ADOPTION OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE AND ELECTION OF CHAIRMAN AND VICE-CHAIRMAN The Sub-Commission adopted the provisional agenda prepared by the Secretariat in consultation with the Chairman , and endorsed the Rules of Procedure approved only provisionally at the first session , altering Rule 7 to read : `` The Sub-Commission shall elect , from among the delegates , a Chairman and a Vice-Chairman , whose term of office shall be two years , and who shall at all events remain in office until the meeting following that at which they were elected .
They shall be eligible for re-election .
'' Mr. PAVARI , and Mr. CHALLOT , the retiring Chairman and Vice-Chairman respectively , were unanimously re-elected .
In accordance with Rule 36 of the Rules of Procedure , French was adopted as the working language for the second session .
II - PROBLEMS ARISING OUT OF " ENDOTHIA PARASITICA " IN THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION The Sub-Commission took note of the report drawn up by Professor PAVARI and Mr. BIRAGHI , and presented by Prof. PAVARI , and expressed its thanks to the authors .
The Sub-Commission felt that it should await the findings of the International Chestnut Congress to be held in France in September 1950 , before taking any decision in the matter .
The Secretary was instructed to follow the work of the Congress .
The Sub-Commission also heard statements by the delegates of Portugal and Switzerland on preventive measures taken against this disease in their respective countries .
III - PROBLEMS STUDIED - SETTING UP OF WORKING PARTIES After further explanations by the authors of the reports on items 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 of the agenda , there was some general discussion of these items ; after which the Sub-Commission referred the study of the various problems to three Working Parties .
The membership of these is shown in Annex 2 .
These three Working Parties took note of the various studies prepared and discussed the problems thoroughly .
Their own subsequent reports , as amended and approved by the Sub-Commission , make up the next three sections of the present document : IV - DELIMITATION OF THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF ECOLOGICAL AREAS 1 .
After considering and studying the maps submitted by Mr. de PHILIPPIS and Mr. GAUSSEN , the Sub-Commission felt that the following territories should be FAO / CEF / SCM / 32 Page 3 represented on the Sub-Commission : ALBANIA , BULGARIA , EGYPT , FRANCE and the FRENCH UNION ( Metropolitan France , Algeria , Tunisia and Morocco ) , GREECE , ISLANDS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN ( Cyprus etc. ) , IRAQ , ISRAEL , ITALY , JORDAN , LEBANON , LIBYA , PORTUGAL , SPAIN , SWITZERLAND , SYRIA , TURKEY and YUGOSLAVIA .
Most of these countries have eumediterranean regions ; some - Switzerland , Bulgaria , Iraq and Egypt - have only transition regions .
2 .
In accordance with the decisions of the Rome session a provisional map was drawn up , giving : ( a ) the boundaries of the eumediterranean region ; ( b ) the boundaries of the transition regions .
The criteria adopted in the light of reports and discussions will enable another provisional map to be drawn up , which will be reproduced in a number of copies and submitted to all the countries concerned .
The criticisms on comments made by these countries will then be used to prepare a map for publication later .
The Sub-Commission drew attention to the need for all countries to define the boundaries of the `` transition '' regions , taking into account their peculiar agricultural and pastoral economies .
As regards the regions of transition to desert , it was suggested that the boundary line be drawn at the steppes of esparto grass and artemisia ( Artemisia Herba Alba ) , thus slightly altering the Rome wording ( Section IIB ) .
The Sub-Commission also requested the countries concerned to supply the Secretariat with documentation to enable it to establish a definitive map which could be regarded as the official map for the purposes of the Sub-Commission .
The documentation asked for is : ( i ) a map defining the boundaries and distribution of the olive tree , if possible setting out separately : - the olive cultivated without irrigation ( number of trees and density of growth ) ; - the wild olive ( Oleaster ) ; - the olive irrigated systematically ; ( ii ) delimitation of Mediterranean forest vegetation , especially a study of the distribution of the following eumediterranean species ; - Aleppo pine , and Brutia pine , - stone pine , FAO / CEF / SCM / 32 Page 4 - pinaster pine and its Mediterranean variety , - cypress , - Algerian thuja , - carob , - cork oak - green oak - kermes oak As regards the transition areas , it would be useful to have data on the distribution of the main forest species , namely : - laricio pines ( Black , Corsican , Calabrian etc. ) - Mediterranean firs , - cedars , - junipers , - deciduous or marcescent oaks , - chestnuts , - hophornbeam Each country might furnish data on other species of economic importance .
3 .
In order to establish the detailed ecological map as proposed at the Rome session , the Sub-Commission requested each country to provide the Secretariat with the fullest possible information on the following points : ( i ) climate - statistical data , and if possible climatic maps and diagrams covering fairly long periods .
The data of most interest to the experts are the following : - Rainfall ( annual , monthly , or failing these , seasonal ) ; - number of days of rain ; - temperature ( actual ) for the month , or failing that , for the season ; - absolute minima and their frequency ; - mean absolute minima ; - absolute maxima ; - mean absolute maxima .
Other information ( number of days of frost , i.e. with a minimum temperature below 0 degrees , winds , humidity , luminosity , evaporation , snow ) would also be useful and might be furnished as well .
Where no printed documents are available , it would be useful if the data could be given for several typical localities .
( ii ) Soil - Pedological and geological maps 4 .
So far , Portugal is the only country which has submitted a detailed ecological map covering all its continental territory .
Similar maps are being prepared in other countries .
FAO / CEF / SCM / 32 Page 5 Pending the establishment of the ecological map , the Sub-Commission felt that it would be useful for its work on reforestation , introduction of exotic species etc ., to prepare an outline map delimiting the Mediterranean climate and showing its phytoclimatic structure .
5 .
The Sub-Commission recommended that contact be established with the International Union of Forest Research Organizations on all matters connected with the establishment of the ecological map .
6 .
The Sub-Commission asked the Working Party set up at the present session to continue to function until the next Session , and to carry on its work by correspondence , through the Secretariat , to establish the various maps proposed .
V - STUDIES ON CORK AND FOREST PRODUCTS OTHER THAN CORK 1 .
Studies on Cork Three separate points were raised : ( i ) permanence of markets ; ( ii ) production statistics ; ( iii ) ways of improving and stabilising productions .
( i ) Markets It would be useful to know before discussion of the question whether in view of the attempts by certain countries to build up cork-producing forests , the countries at present exporting cork were acting wisely in investing considerable capital in the regeneration of their cork oak forests .
Will the world market still be open to the produce of these forests in 30 to 40 years time ?
It would appear that they will .
In the non Mediterranean countries , the cork-oak would only have a real chance of success if planted in soil suitable for more economically valuable species .
Also , the various vegetable substitutes cannot compete with cork from the cork-oak .
It was further remarked , on the subject of possible investment , that it is impossible to calculate the financial yield since no-one can prophesy future developments in an economic situation which is already very fluid ; all that can be done is to assess the yield in material from development schemes undertaken .
Investment , once the risk of an unforeseeable future is accepted , constitutes an insurance .
FAO / CEF / SCM / 32 Page 6 2 .
Statistics The study of statistics is the first item in the Portuguese delegation ' s report on measures to promote and protect cork production in the Mediterranean area .
This report was adopted by the Sub-Commission as a possible guide for its work ( see Annex 3 ) .
The future of cork seems to be dependent on the possibility of export at low and stable prices .
The inventory of cork-oak forests and production statistics for natural raw cork are in fact data necessary to show the potentialities of the market and to establish annual production estimates on which a price policy can be based .
The States concerned would do well to provide one another periodically with such inventories and statistics ; these should be drawn up in accordance with uniform principles and standards , to be defined by the Sub-Commission .
3 .
Studies and Improvements The report already mentioned summarises all the questions likely to arise in respect of cork production .
All these questions are of considerable importance ; but studies might well be undertaken in an order of priority .
The Sub-Commission felt that in the first instance the technical questions under items 2 - " Regeneration " ; 5 - " Exploitation `` and 7a - " Technical Qualities " , of the report in question should be given priority .
The co-ordination of these studies would fit in with item 4 of the report .
The Sub-Commission therefore decided to set up a permanent working party under the chairmanship of Mr. NATIVIDADE ( Portugal ) , and with the following members : Mr. GIORDANO ( Italy ) , Mr. DUGELAY ( France ) , Mr. METRO ( Morocco ) , Mr. MONJAUZE ( Algeria ) , and the Chairman of the '' National Cork Board " or his deputy ( Portugal ) .
The work of the permanent working party would be concentrated on the points set out above , and would be communicated to the Sub-Commission at each of its periodical sessions .
This working party would also draw up the necessary statistical questionnaires and requests for information , to be sent to the States concerned by the Sub-Commission 's Secretariat ( Forestry and Forest Products Division of FAO ) FAO / CEF / SCM / 32 Page 7 2 .
Studies on Forest Products other than cork In view of the importance of exotic species and secondary forest products for the whole Mediterranean Basin , the Sub-Commission recommended an intensification of technological research on such species and products , and exchange of information on results achieved .
The following products in particular call for attention : Acacia and eucalyptus tannins , Briar roots , Pine resin , Ash osiers :, Pine-cones , Oak apples , etc. Special mention should be made of pine resin .
The problem of resins comprises the following factors : - Competition of `` white spirit '' with turpentine ; - Abandonment of tapping as a result of this competition , - Social and economic consequence of abandoning tapping .
It was therefore recommended that technological studies should be directed in particular to research on chemical compounds obtained from resin and more valuable than turpentine .
VI - REFORESTATION - SOIL CONSERVATION AND UTILIZATION-MEASURES TAKEN OR TO BE TAKEN FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF DEMONSTRATION AREAS The Sub-Commission listened to the various reports on the problems of reforestation , soil conservation and land use , and confirmed the conclusions reached at its previous session in Rome in December 1948 .
It laid special stress on the importance of paragraph 2 of the above - mentioned conclusions , recommending Governments " to limit reforestation properly so-called to purely forestland , and to apply to land suitable for other uses soil restoration practices based on the same principles of protecting slopes and regulating stream-flow " .
In view of the fact that reforestation involves the prohibition of cutting , and the eviction and resettlement of forest-dwellers , and also that when employed alone , its effect on stream-flow is a long-term matter , the Sub-Commission decided that it would be advisable to apply some method of soil restoration on sloping ground which would : ( l ) have an effect comparable to that of forests on soil conservation and regulation of stream-flow ; ( 2 ) make full use of the soil , and so improve the standard of living of the hill-folk .
FAO / CEF / SCM / 32 Page 8 After visiting the extensive work undertaken in Algeria by the Soil Protection and Restoration Department , the Sub-Commission agreed that for this purpose the technique of infiltration terraces ( " banquettes d ' infiltration " ) developed and successfully applied on an enormous scale ( to date about 20,000 hectares ) would appear to be one of the best methods of solving the problem employed so far .
This technique also helps to improve the livelihood of the inhabitants by making fuller and more scientific use of the soil .
This fact itself means that forest pasturage no longer being a social necessity , the development of forests and the reforestation of zones not amenable to better use becomes politically and economically feasible .
The Sub-Commission drew the attention of governments to the value of this technique , which had been tried out and deserved to be quoted as an example ; and it recommended them to publicise as widely as possible throughout their administrative and technical departments the valuable reports it had received , so that the experience gained might be made available as quickly as possible to all the Mediterranean countries .
Since conservation of the existing forest areas is essential to the physical and economical stability of the Mediterranean countries , and since it is vital that vast stretches of mountainous territory at present denuded should be restored with the utmost urgency , the Sub-Commission called the attention of the governments to the danger of a policy of exploitation involving further clearing of forest soil on the grounds that it can be cultivated again by means of restoration methods ; and it recommended them : ( 1 ) to follow a firm policy of conservation and development of existing forests ; ( 2 ) to limit restoration operations to soil in which the forest cover has disappeared , and to agricultural land suffering from or threatened with erosion ; ( 3 ) to adopt reforestation and restoration methods combined , in areas where the state of the soil calls for such action .
The Sub-Commission also noted with satisfaction that this interplay of agricultural , pastoral and forestry problems in mountainous country had been realized by most countries , and that in many cases the forestry services , with their long and expert experience in combating erosion , had been entrusted with the co-ordination of research and the technical control of operations .
In view of the magnificent social results obtained in Algeria , the Sub-Commission warmly recommended that the system be applied more generally .
FAO / CEF / SCM / 32 Page 9 The interplay of these factors and their impact on the economic and social fields seemed to the Sub-Commission to justify the need for countries benefiting by the technical assistance programme of ECA , to give priority to operations of this kind .
The Sub-Commission also stressed the importance of the consequences of erosion on the utilisation and regulation of streams ; and recommended that soil restoration in the catchment areas should precede or at least accompany the construction of dams .
Finally , believing that the work it had seen in Algeria was of such international interest that a far wider publicity should be given to it , the Sub-Commission recommended : ( 1 ) that other countries faced with similar erosion problems should send technicians to study the techniques of soil conservation in use in Algeria , and that the French Government should be invited to grant every facility to choose technicians in order that they may visit Algeria and study the technique on site ; ( 2 ) that the French Government be invited to make available advisers on this problem to other interested countries , should it be invited to do so .
REMARKS : At the final meeting , following a speech by Mr. LELOUP and a proposal by Mr. TAYLOR ( United Kingdom ) regarding the agenda for the next session , there was some discussion as to the definition of the term `` purely forest land '' and the proper relationship between pasturage and forest .
The Sub-Commission decided to maintain the original text as it stood , and to take up the discussion at its next session .
It also instructed the Secretary to submit a report on the question at that session .
VII - THE POPLAR IN THE MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES The Sub-commission listened to a report on the poplar in Italy presented by Professor PICCAROLO , and thanked him for his contribution , placing upon record the fact that he was willing to place at the disposal of delegates who might be interested the experience already acquired at his Institute .
FAO / CEF / SCM / 32 Page 10 VIII - DATE AND PLACE OF THE NEXT SESSION - AGENDA The Secretariat informed the Sub-Commission of the invitation from Lebanon and Israel , and the Sub-Commission took note of these and expressed its thanks , instructing the Secretariat , in collaboration with the Chairman , to carry on conversations with the countries mentioned , in connection with the organisation of subsequent sessions .
The Sub-Commission also requested that the following topic be put on the agenda of the next session : " The study of the necessity for the controlling of grazing in order to establish a balance between pasturage and forestry which would allow the restoration of forests and the eventual maximum yield of production from the land " .
IX - DISTRIBUTION OF THE REPORT AND DOCUMENTS In his closing speech , the Chairman requested the Food and Agriculture Organization to consider the possibility of printing the final report and the various technical reports submitted , so that these documents , which constituted a valuable source of information , might go along with the documents from previous sessions to form a compact and easily accessible collection .

The cultivation of the cork-oak ( Quercus suber ) constitutes the basis of one of the prime sources of forest wealth in the Mediterranean area , its importance being enhanced by the fact that it grows under the edapho-climatic conditions to which only very few species of silvicultural value are capable of adapting themselves .
It renders exploitable vast areas which , in its absence and exposed to the depredations caused by man and beast , would otherwise be condemned to the dire poverty peculiar to certain arid regions .
Many factors have played their part in the course of time in reducing the area occupied by the cork-oak ; all signs point to the fact that the limits of its true habitat have suffered contraction .
Although the commercial value of cork , during the past 5O years , has led to the intensive exploitation of cork-oak forests and the application of protective measures , it is nevertheless true that the prospects for cork production cannot be regarded at the moment as being very brilliant .
Yet the rather unstable position occupied by the Mediterranean cork-oak cultivation is hardly discernible from the statistics .
The cork-oak stands handed down to us still , of course , cover a vast area and are of great value .
Nevertheless , the occasional intensive exploitation - or even over exploitation - of both the soil and the trees , the inadequate regeneration of groves which have reached the limit of economic exploitation , the growing difficulties due to the advanced stage of deterioration of cork-producing areas which often impede recourse to natural regeneration and finally the owners ' reluctance to devote capital to the task of artificial regeneration - a reluctance partly justified by uncertainty as to the future of cork-growing or the discouragement caused by the failure of the prices of cork and other cork-forest products to fall in line with currency devaluation - constitute factors which at present dim the prospects of Mediterranean cork-production and call for the far-sighted attention of the countries concerned .
FAO / CEF / SCM / 32 Page 15 In the matter of legislation for the conservation of the cork-oak , technical assistance , research , action against pests and diseases , measures to promote cork-oak cultivation , the publication of improved cultivation standards and the protection and popularization of commercial cork products , Portugal , conscious of her responsibility as the leading producer country , has done extensive work of outstanding importance .
Nevertheless , there is felt to be a growing need for securing the cooperation of all countries concerned in cultivating the cork-oak with a view to safeguarding cork-oak forests throughout the entire Mediterranean area and applying improved methods for their conservation and exploitation .
We indicate below , in general terms , the principles whereby such co-operation may become truly fruitful : 1 ) Intensification of survey work in areas occupied by the cork-oak and the taking of an inventory of present forest stocks so as to permit annual harvest estimates on the basis of possibilities ; and the introduction of " am e nagement " in all forestry undertakings .
The organization of production statistics with a high standard of accuracy .
2 ) The natural and artificial regeneration of stands .
The co-ordination of current research work in the various countries .
Exchange of information between the countries concerned as to the results obtained .
3 ) Conservation of soil bearing cork-oak stands with a view to : ( a ) mitigating the effects of soil exhaustion brought about by agricultural cropping in the cork-oak forests in areas where this type of farming is economically linked up with their exploitation ; ( b ) combating erosion in cork-oak forests in mountainous areas ; ( c ) examining the possibility , with a view to soil conservation in particular , of re-introducing some of the constructive features of natural forests into the groves : ( i ) the re-establishment of suitable climax associations less vulnerable to fire than Cistus , Erica , Lavandula and Rosmarinus coppice ; ( ii ) a study of methods of reducing fire risks in cases where the coppice is retained .
4 ) Co-ordination of past and prospective studies , and closer cooperation between the Research Stations of the various countries in scientific investigations in the following fields : ( a ) intensification of research work on the physiology of the cork-oak and on the biology of the groves .
FAO / CEF / SCM / 32 Page 16 ( b ) extension of studies on genetics and of work on selecting and improving the cork-oak .
( c ) intensification of studies on the biology of the pests and diseases attacking the cork-oak , and the formulation of a rational plan for protecting forest masses ; ( d ) development of studies on aspects of phyto-sociology primarily concerning cork-oak forests ; ( e ) intensification of technological investigations into the technical and economic possibilities of exploiting the timber of the corkoak , and the cork itself , as well as into methods for utilising , exploiting and conserving the fruit , particularly in countries where stock-raising is practised in conjunction with cork-growing .
( 5 ) Exploitation , Cultivation technique : ( a ) formulation of intensive measures for cultivating the cork-oak without harming the forest reserves and without entailing impoverishment of the soil ; ( b ) studies on the optimum density of stands under different growing conditions , and the technique of thinning .
( c ) advantages and disadvantages , in the Mediterranean area , of mixed and unmixed stands ; stands consisting of trees of the same or different age-groups .
( d ) determination of scientific standards for the technique and intensity of cork-harvesting ; ( e ) control of grazing in cork-oak forests or uncultivated lands suitable for cork-growing , with a view to obviating any action which might impede natural regeneration of stands or produce further deterioration of the soil .
( 6 ) encouragement of cork-oak cultivation : ( a ) survey of new terrain for the expansion of cork-oak cultivation in each country , with due regard for optimum ecological conditions for that species ; ( b ) adoption of various methods for providing technical assistance and financial aid to owners .
( 7 ) Co-ordination of efforts to protect cork production : FAO / CEF / SCM / 32 page 17 ( a ) intensification of studies on improving the quality of cork , with a view to endowing that raw material with the technical qualities required for industrial purposes ; ( b ) intensification of research work on the chemical composition of cork and new uses to which it may be put ; ( c ) the methodical organization of publicity in favour of cork and its manufactured products ; ( d ) formulation of plans for cork production , distribution and consumption .
With a view to ensuring closer co-operation and freer interchange between the countries interested in cork-oak cultivation , we also suggest the establishment of a Mediterranean Commission ( or Centre ) for the Study of the Cork-Oak for the purpose of co-ordinating , collating and publishing the results of the researches carried out in the various countries and of establishing closer contact between the technical experts engaged on experimental and research work in connection with cork production .
A COMPARISON OF THE HYDROLOGICAL EASTERN AND WESTERN COASTS A comparison is made of the hydrological properties of the two principal water types of the east and weat Australian fringing wacers and the general validlty and application of such a method to comparative estimates of oceanic fertility and to che ecology of wide-ranging fish species , such as the tunas for example , are discussed .

In both cases the dots represent Pacific and the crosses Indian Ocean material .
Neglecting the immediate surface layers , it is possible in all stations with depths of at least 1,000 metres to distinguish a subsurfa.ce water type with a salinity maximum at a depth of 100 to 200 metres , and a deep water type with a salinity minimum at a depth of 800 to 1,000 metres .
In Fig. 1 , representing conditions at a distance of 60 miles offshorp , the subsurface water types have been marked at points A ' and B ' , and the deep water types at points C ' and D f .
At a distance of 100 miles offshore ( Fig. 2 ) , the equivalent water types can be distinguished at points A `` , B '' , C `` and D '' respectively .
At both stations in Fig. 1 it is possible to detect a surface water typewhose properties would probably vary so much under the infiuerce of local factors as to render its separate identification of doubtful value .
In any case , the comparative shallownes ~ of the subsurface water type facilitates mixing with , and enables it to act as a primary source for the genesis of these purely surface water types .
In this paper , therefore , no attention has been paid to the immediate surface layers and the comparison of 1ndia.n and Pacific Ocean fringing waters has been based upon the properties of the subsurface and decp water types .
In Table 1 the depth , salinity and temperature of each of these water types at successive stations during the October surveys are given .
Although some variation in the magnitude of these properties of the surface water types occurs between stations , the differences are such as one would expect local mixing exchanges to cause in an initially homoge - OlVlSION.06 FISHERIES VERTICAL TEMPERATURE SHEET scation 100 MILES .

In the case of the deep water type , however , it is clear that we are not only dealing with the same water type in each ocean , but with a common inter-oceanic water type existing at this deep level .
Its properties identify it as sub-Antarctic intermediate water and it has been designated accordingly .
The mean salinity of the subsurface water type is higher inTthe Indim than in the Pacific Ocean .
The temperature of the latter water type is , however , higher .
' The vertical distribution of temperature at a distance of 100 miles offshore in the Indian Ocean , plotted as crosses , and the Pacific Ocean , plotted as dots , ( Fig. 3 ) shows quite clearly the overall higher temperature of the latter ocean .
Although the properties of the sub-Antarctic water type are similar in both oceans , the depth of occurrence in the Indian is less than in the Pacific Ocean .
The bathymetric features of these two regions probably play a major role in such a difference .

`` Warreen '' in this area ( data in press ) it is possible to deduce the occurrence of a large-scale eddy system as a normal feature of the late winter early spring period in this region .
The disruption of the east Australian current system and the homogeneity of the surface layers in the section could be a normal consequence of the decay of this eddy system .

The low N / P ratio in the New South Wales offshore water type is probably due to differences in the rates of local turnover of phosphates and nitrates , and of the differing depths at which full regeneration of phosphates and nitrates occurs .
On the other hand , in the sub-Antarctic water mass , in which one would expect to find relatively .
similar nutrient conditions , big differences are encountered .
The nitrogen to phosphorus ratio in the New South Wales sub-Antarctic witer type is not far below an average of 6.8 : 1 for ocean waters in general ( Cooper 1938 ) .
The N / P ratio for the corresponding sub-Antarctic water mass in the Indian Ocean is , however , abnormally high ( Table 2 ) .
From the previous data collected by F.R.V .
`` Warreen '' in this area , however , ( Table 5 ) it is clear that the K / P ratio generally agrees closely with the N / P ratio for the corresponding east Australian sub-Antarctic water mass .
( Table 4 ) .
It is probable , then , that during the October 1950 survey incomplete phosphate regeneration had occurred in this water type off the west Australian coast .
I t is quite possible also that at any particular time the sub-Antarctic water types of the fringing Indian and Pacific Oceans have had their genesis during different periods of the nutrient calendar in the sub-Antarctic surface waters of south latitudes .
A cyclical meridional variation in nutrient content , similar to that demonstrated by Deacon ( 1933 ) for dissolved oxygen in the South Atlantic deeper layers , may be effective here also .
The rather complicated and indirect route for the northward movement of sub-Antarctic water into the Australian Pacific , compared with that into the Indian Ocean fringing regions ( Schott 1935 , Plate IV ) is also presumably an important factor .

Q06 / 67 % The lower saturation figures for oxygen in the Pacific , compared with figures in the Indian Ocean sub-Antarctic water type ( Table 3 ) , can be considered as further evidence of the disparity in age of these water types , although it could be simply a measure of the degree of mixing exchange at this depth .
The difference in linearity of the S. T. curves at the 100 mile offshore station ( Fig. 2 ) is evidence of less vertical mixing between the subsurface and sub-Antarctic water types in the Indian , compared with the Pacific Ocean , fringing waters .
At the 60 mile offshore station ( Fig. I ) more vertical mixing occurs in the Indian Ocean water column , and , at the 30 mile offshore station , there occurs an almost completely linear relationship of salinity to The distribution of inorganic phosphates in a section extending roo miles west of Rottnest Island on 5 -6 .

However , the higher oxygen saturation of the subAntarctic water type ( Table 3 ) in this region does not support such an hypothesis .
The oceanographical work of F.R.V .
`` Warreen '' in this area ( data in press ) has shown this cellular distribution of nutrients to be a normal feature of the west Australian fringing waters , and their occurrence must in all probability be attributed to in situ phenomena at the source of the component water types ( see p. 64 ) I I P04P .

19.12 Mean 18.95 Date Water types Subsurface Sub-Antarctic I I I I I I I I THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE WATER TYPES IN THE HYDROLOGY OF THE REGION OF OCCURRENCE In Table 4 are given the properties of the water at the subsurface maximum and at the subsurface minimum salinity layer .
I t is evident that the waters occurring at these levels are very comparable in hydrological properties with the New South Wales offshore and sub-Antarctic water types found in October 1950 .
The continued existence of the New South Wales offshore water type over such a wide period and at most times of the year suggests rather conclusively that this water type is a persistent element of the east Australian system .
Presumably it represents the water type or core of the east Australian current system , and its distribution in both the vertical and lateral planes is governed by the dynamics of this current system .
Upon it as a foundation the local surface hydrological features are established .
Whilst there is no biological evidence as yet to support it , it is not unreasonable to suppose that a fishery such as the tuna fishery might be found associated with a subsurface water type of this nature .
In this case , fluctuations in abundance of such a fishery would be dependent upon the voIume of this particular water type and its depth distribution rather than upon immediate and local nutrient conditions , which in any case could not be of major importance to a wide-ranging fish of this nature .
In Table 5 the properties for all available data of the water at the depth of the salinity maximum and salinity minimum layer of the waters off Rottnest Island , Western Australia , are given .
Although the mean salinity figure is almost identical with that encountered in October , 1950 , the dispersion of the individual salinity figures is rather high and it is probable that we are not in this case dealing with a conservative water type of the east Australian pattern , but with a more variable water mass .
The salinity of the sub-Antarctic water type at the depth of occurrence of the salinity minimum layer is also more variable than its east Australian equivalent .
It is also apparent that the very high nitrate figures for this water type in October , 1950 ( Table 2 ) are rather abnormal and that the mean nutrient content is not very different from the mean for the same water type on the east Australian coast .
A negative anomaly in the N / P ratio of the surface waters is a general feature of the west Australian subsurface water mass .
The salinity minimum layer is also more variable than its east Austrzlian equivalent .
Undoubtedly , however , this deep water type is sub-Antarctic in origin .
The relationship of the subsurface west Australian water type or water mass to the comparatively illdefined and irregular west Australian offshore current is not as consistent as the corresponding relationship on the east Australian coast .
It is probable , however , that it represents the fundamental and most persistent subsurface water type of this region and that as is the case off the east Australian coast , its properties represent a base level upon which the effects of local factors are superimposed .
Considered in this light , therefore , the comparative nutrient poverty of the Indian compared with the , Pacific Ocean subsurface water types ( Tables 4 and 5 ) could be of considerable importance .
ORIGIN OF THE SUBSURFACE WATER TYPES The salinity temperature properties of the New South Wales offshore water type are within the range of those of surface sub-tropical waters of low latitudes .
However the nutrient content , and in particular the phosphate content , is rather high for such an origin and it seems likely , therefore , that it has originated in the deeper and nutrient-richer subtropical layers before its incorporation into the east Australian system .
From the general distribution of salinity and temperature in the Indian Ocesn ( Schott 1935 ) it is possible to postulate the origin of the west Australian offshore water type .
In Piate XXVII Schott ( loc .
cit .
) shows the existence of a central pool of water , with salinities of the same order as those of the west Australian offshore water type , lying between longitudes 80 % .
and 1 10 degrees E. Presumably then , the eastward drift from within this region ( Schott loc .
cit ., Plate XXX ) carries some of this high salinity water into the west Australian region , where it constitutes the core of the west Australian current system .
Although no nutrient data are available for the central Indian Ocean , the origin of this water type from a region of probable isolation and nutrient impoverishment is also consistent with its low phosphate and nitrate content ( Table 5 ) .
Schott ( loc .
cit ., Plate XXVI ) also lists the central Indian Ocean region as having a negative surface temperature anomaly , which agrees with the temperature conditions prevailing off the east and west Australian coasts in comparable latitudes ( Fig. 3 ) .

Mean DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS conception has much general application , it is quite possible that in some fish groups a number of environmental factors acting in unison are responsible for geographical limits of their distribution and , in some cases , for the depth strata occupied .
The conception of water types or water masses as ecological niches with fairly narrow ranges of environmental variability , but with considerable variation in geographical and depth distribution and in interoceanic source regions , could provide an answer to some of the puzzling features of oceanwide tuna distribution , and their habitats .
Whilst lack of sufficient breadth in the available oceanographical data rather limits the hydrological conclusions to be drawn from this paper , it is clear that certain basic and fairly persistent water types can be distinguished , and that the consistent differences in the nutrient content of the subsurface water types off the east and west Australian coast lines are significant in the basic fertility of these regions .
As to whether any persistent association of organisms , including fish groups , can be related to these water types cannot on available evidcnce be determined .
As a working hypothesis , therefore , the concept of water types containing persistent association of organisms is suggested for investigation by the other members of the Indo-Pacific Fisheries Council , In hydrology it is often difficult to make comparisons between the fertility and ecological characteristics of the immediate surface layers of different oceans .
The changes in hydrological properties are often so rapid and localized in extent as to make any comparisons based upon a small number of sampling observations , statistically very unreliable .
The method that has been followed in this paper is therefore in the nature of an experiment to determine whether more stable , and hence statistically more reliable for a given number of observations , core layers can be isolated from each region and utilized for a comparison of their hydrological properties .
Moreover , from an ecological point of view it is more probable that these persistent rather stable core layers , rather than purely local variations in surface hydrological conditions , provide the clue to the ocean-wide distribution of such a far-ranging and fairly omnivorous fish group as the tunas .
The origin and genesis of such water types may also provide valuable information upon the breeding phase and larval concentrations of such a fishery .
Bio-geographical indices of fish distribution are often based upon single variables of the environment , and in particular temperature .

These investigations were started in January 1948 and continued till the end of December 1949 .
Samples of water were collected at fortnightly intervals throughout this period and the salinity and phosphate content determined by the usual standard methods .
The temperature of the water was determined simultaneously and plankton samples were also collected by filtering sea water pumped from different levels between the surface and the sea bottom .
The volume of the settled plankton was measured .
The pigment content of an aliquot part of the sample was determined and expressed in Harvey units , whilst the numbers of phytoplankton and zooplankton organisms were also estimated , At the same time detailed records ere kept of the catch of three selected fish traps ( Kelongs ) in Singapore Straits .
These fish traps are built by planting poles into the sea bottom to form two inter-communicating enclosures , the second of which is blind .
Short rows of poles are also planted on both sides outside the entrance to the first enclosure .
Fish moving with the tides aie infircepted by a long lead which guides the fish into the first enclosure .
The fish is removed from the second or blind enclosure by means of a lift net .
A detailed description of this method of fishing has been given by LeMare and Tham .
These traps are operated every day throughout the year in aH conditions of tide and weather so that the fishing intensity is constant .
The total catches of these traps around Singapore represent 7 0 ' ~ ~ of the total local landings so that they are considered to give a good indication of the availability of fish in Singapore Straits .

PHYSICO-CHEMICAL NATURE OF THE EFFLUENTS The wastes discharged from the mills come from ( a ) the manufacture of pulp from different raw materials , such as bamboos , rags and waste paper , ( b ) purification of pulp , and ( c ) the manufacture of craft paper .
Each of these processes is carried out in three different sections ( Fig. 1 ) .
In the preparation of fibre for the paper , 30 % of the pulp used is from bamboos , 10 % from rags and 60 % from waste paper .
The main process of making pulp from bamboo consists of removing the non cellulose portion like lignin by treatment under pressure with a solution containing 8 % caustic soda and 20 % sodium sulphide .
The waste ligneous liquor , after further treatments for chemical recovery , is very dark in colour and contains sulphides , sulphates , lime , soda and suspended matter .
It is lead out separately by a channel and is accumulated in a tank outside the premises of the mills before discharge into the river .
Old gunny bags , rags , etc ., are boiled with lime or soda and washed with water , while waste papers are sorted out and kneaded into a pulp with water and steam .
These pulpy materials are made ink proof by the addition of rosin and alum .
The effluent from the pulp section thus consists of excess water used for washing and screenillg the pulp .
This waste water along with lime sludge of the causticizers goes in a drain , and passes through baffle walls where lime sludge is deposited and then passes out as effluent .
T-he effluent from the paper section consists of water and minute particles of pulp in suspension .
This is taken by a separate drain to settling tanks from which it passes out as a yellowish oily supernatant liquor containing about 0.01 % of resin and alum .

G : Outfall of Common Effluent : Channel .
H : Intake Tower .
The effluents from these three sections then mix together and flow into the river through an open drain .
The total quantity of effluents discharged from the mills in a day is about 60,000 gallons .
The results of two typical analyses of the effluents from the three sections and from the final outflow channel are shown in Table I , from which it will be seen that the effluent from the raw materials section is noxious while those from the other two sections appear to be harmless .
But the mixture which reaches the river is also harmful as is evident from the results of experiments given in Table 11 , from which it will be noted that the liquid has the capacity to reduce the oxygen content of stagnant water .
Further , similar samples when stored for a week became darker , forming flocculent precipitates and also producing hydrogen sulphide .
Similar action is likely to take place if this black liquor is allowed to stagnate in any open place .
CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE IN THE RIVER GODAVARI The Godavari river is in flood from July to December and during the rest of the year it contains little water with practically no flow .
During flood the river is characterised by great velocity of flow , fluctuating depth and muddy discolouration .
During this periodit is not possible for the mills ' effluents to reach the river by gravitational flow , because the flood water backs up through the outflow discharge channel .
I t is only when the level of water in the river falls below that of the canal that the effluent is freely discharged into the river .
But at this time there is not much flow in the river and therefore proper mixing and dilution of the effluent seems not to take place .
The physico-chemical conditions of the river during the floods ( Table 111 ) show that the effluents have no effect on the river during this period .
This river stretch has been found by Chacko ( 1946 , 1949 ) , Chacko and Ganapati ( 1950 ) , and Job and Chacko ( 1947 ) to be the spawning and nursery grounds of major carps such as Catla catla , Cirrhina mrigala , Labeo Jimbriatus , L. calbasu , L. boga , L. ariza , Thynnichthys sandkhol and Puntius kolus .
Chacko ( 1947 ) and Chacko and Ganapati ( 1949 ) have observed the Indian Shad , Hilsa iiisha , performing its migration through this river stretch .
During the non flood season ( January to June ) .
the river becomes lentic in condition .
The levcI of water gradually goes down because of both evaporation as well as of the draw-off for irri ation d purposes .
It is during this period that the e uents from the mills cause harm to the fish population within a Iimit of about 1 mile below the outfall .
A bird's-eye view of the river from the embankment of the river where the effluents are discharged ( Fig I ) , as on 13th April 1950 , presentedan interesting sight .
For about one mile below the outfall and one furlong above it and about four furlongs towards the middle of the river , the river water was black in appearance .
Beyond this region the water was bottle-green in colour .
The black portion Was the area affected by the effluents .
This dry weather condition continues till the end of June and the area of pollution is thus bound to increase much further within that period .
In the polluted area , soft , fluffy , floating , decomposing , flocs of aluminium hydroxide and organic matter were seen in abundance .
Copious gases were also seen escaping from the bottom on probing with a stick .
The depth of water in these places was about 4 to 5 feet only .
Samples of water taken from these places contain oxygen in fair amounts ( 5.026 cc / l ) while near the outfall it was very low ( 0.838 cc / l ) .
The other physico-chemical conditions are detailed in Table IV , Trial nettings with a cast net revealed the presence of small species of fishes such as Barbus ticto , B. stigma , Rasbora daniconius , Ambassis ranga and Glossogobius giuris , and the prawn Palaemon malcolmsonii .
Macrovegetation like Hydrilla , Vallisneria and Potamogeton were present only in the sheltered portion just above the outfall .
The phytoplankton was represented by few individuals of Myxophyceae ( Arnphithrix , Merismopedia , Microcystis and Oscillatoria ) , Chlorophyceae ( Cladophora , Cosmarium , Oedogonium , Pediastrum and Penium ) , Bacillarieae ( Amphora , Cymbella , Gomphonema , Navicula , Nitzschia , Surirella , Synedra and Tabellaria ) and of Euglenophyceae ( Euglena and Phacus ) .
The zoo plankton was represented by rotifers ( Brachionus , Euchlanis , Noteus , Notholca , Pedalion , Rattulus and Rotifer ) and copepods ( Diaptomus and Eucyclops ) .
The bottom fauna consisted of dipteran larvae ( Chironomus ) , worms ( Chaetogaster ) and gastropods ( Vivipara variata and Pabdomus stomatodon ) .
Dead shells of Corbicula striatella , Melania tuberculatus , Indoplartorbis exustus and Limnaea succinea were found scattered about at the bottom .
The physico-chemical conditions of the nonpolluted portion of the river is givenin Table IV , from which it will be seen that inthis region the water is not only bottle green in colour , indicating the presence of phytoplankton , but is also highly alkaline ( pH : 5.5 ) and highly oxygenated ( 85 to 93 % saturated ) .
' I'he plankton was rich and varied and consisted of Myxophyceae ( Amphithrix , Anabaena , Merismopedia , Oscillatoria and Tetrapedia ) , Cyanophyceae ( Coelastrurri , Closterium , Cosmarium , Dictoysphaerium , Euastrum , Genicularia , Golenkinia , Gonatozygon , Oocystis , Pandorina , Pediastrum , Penium , Pleurococcus and Sphaerocystis ) , Bacillarieae ( Amphora , Cymbella , Eunotia , Gomphonema , Gyrosigma , Navicula , Surirella and Synedra ) , Dinophyceae ( Glenodenium ) , Euglenophyceae ( Eu - glena ) , Rotifera ( Brachionus , Euchlanis and Notholca ) , Cladocera ( Diaphanosoma , Alonella , Simocephalus , Daphnia and Bosmina ) , Ostracoda ( Cypridopsis ) , Copepoda ( Diaptomus and Eucyclops ) .
The bottom fauna was also rich , and consisted of Pelecypoda ( Lamellidens marginalis and Corbicula , striatella ) and Gastropoda ( Melania tuberculatus , Indoplanorbis exustus , Vivipara variata and Paludomus stomatodon ) .
The catches of fishermen who were operating in the river at the time of investigation were examined and found to consist of a variety of species such as Wallago attu , Pseudotropius taarkee , Mystus aor , M. seenghala , M. cavasius , Labeo Jimbriatus , Cirrhina reba , C. mrigala , Catla catla , Thynnichthyssandkhol , Amblypharyngodonmola , Barbus sarana , B. stigma , Rasbora daniconius , Chela bacaila and Rohtee cotio .
Prawns such as Palaemon malcolmsonii and P. scabriculus were also present .
PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES OF FISHES TO DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS OF THE EFFLUENT Laboratory experiments were made to study the response of Barbus stigma to the effluents .
It was found that this species died immediately when placed in the black effluent from the raw materials section , and survived for only 15 minutes in the effluent from the pulp section and for three hours in the effluent from the paper section .
In the mixture of effluents discharged into the river it died within half hour .
By further experiments it was ascertained that the fish survived for several hours in a dilution of one part of the effluent to 500 parts of freshwater .
DISCUSSION There is no doubt that the effect of the effluent from the Andhra Paper Mills is harmful to both fish life and fish food organisms .
The efffuent is black and offensive , reduces oxygen content of water and generates hydrogen sulphide .
There is also deposition of aluminium hydroxide flocs with organic matter covering the river section near the mills , owing to the presence of alum in the effluents .
A marked difference is noticeable between the polluted and non polluted section of the river , the latter being characterised by optimum hvdrobioiogical conditions which are suitable for supporting a rich fish fauna .
It has been experimentally determined that a minimum dilution of 1 : 500 is necessary for safely letting the effluent from the mill into the river .
It has been suggested to the authorities of the mills that the effluents should either be pumped into the river only when the latter is in high floods or that they should be purified ., by some sort of rough and rapid filtration through sand before being discharged into the river .

SUMMARY The Andhra Paper Mills situated on the left bank of the Godavari river near Rajahmundry , discharge ~ bout60 , OOOgallons of its effluents into the river per day during the non flood season .
These effluents are noxious , being black and offensive , reducing the oxygen saturation of the river water .
Flocs of aluminium hydroxide form and cover the surface and bottom of the river in the vicinity .
The hydrobiological conditions of the river during the flood and non flood season in the polluted and nonpolluted regions were studied .
The oxygen content near the outfall of the eauents was as low as 0.838 cc / l. Fish life was represented by a few small species .
The plankton and the bottom fauna were also poor .
On the other hand , tha conditions were satisfactory in the non polluted area , which was rich in plankton , bottom fauna and fish life .
Laboratory experiments showed that dilution to 1 : 500 is necessary to prevent the deleterious effect of the Description effluents .
Suggestions for the disposal .
of the effluents ha.ve been made .

4 A CONTRIBUTION T O THE BIOLOGY OF THE SILVER BELLY , LEIOGN ATHUS SPLENDENS ( CUV .
) `` by H. L. Aroraa * A study of the biology of Leiognntluis spleradens in Indian waters is reported .
Length at first maturity , spawning period , and frequency , growth rate ( in the first tn o years ) , fecundity and length / weight relation have been studied .
The silver belly , Leiognathus splendens , is a small fish attaining an average length of about ten centimeters .
It belongs to the family Leiognathidae .
The body of the fish is oblong and compressed and the mouth is protrusible .
The colour is silvery and hence the name silver belly .
The species is widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific region .
Its occurrence is reported in the seas of India , Malaya , Indonesia , China , Philippines , Queensland and the Fiji Islands .
In India , L. splende ~ is the subject of an important fishery at Thangachimadam on the Rameswaram Island , the annual landings being 500 tons which bring a total value of nearly Rs .
200,000 ( Rs .
4.72 = ca .
$ 1 US in 1951 ) to the fishermen .
There is no fishing for silver bellies during the months from December to February .
The fish is captured by means of a bag net ( local name-Mada valai ) which is of conical shape and of small mesh of & inch .
The net varies in length from 36 to 40 feet with a mouth opening of about the same diameter .
The net is operated from two boat catamarans and at a depth of 3 to 6 fathoms .
Although there are two species of the silver bellies , Leiognathus splendens and Leiognathus ruconius , landed at Thangachimadam , the former constitutes by far the larger element in the commercial catch .
This study deals exclusively with the biology of L. splendens .
The : work was started in September , 1949 , and the data presented in this paper have been gathered entirely from the commercial catches at Thangachimadam .
Because the fishery does not operate in December , January and February , no data were available for these months .
The gap still remains to be filled , yet a certain pattern of life history is evident and some general conclusions are drawn which will be useful in directing the future development of the fishery and measures for its conservation .
The measurements which have been usedthroughout this paper are the standard length of the fish , that is , from the tip of the mandible of the closed mouth to the origin of the caudal fin , recorded in millimetps .
The author wishes to express his sincere thanks to Dr. N. K. Panikkar , Chief Research Officer , Central Marine Fisheries Research Station , MandaPam , for his valuable suggestions in the preparation of this report .

- * Published with the kind permission of the Chief Research Officer , Central Marine Fisheries Research Station , Mandapam camp .
* * From the Central Marine Fisheries Research Station of the Government of India , Mandapam Camp , 75 ' fish studied , and by detailed measurements of the diameters of the eggs from a large number of females .
Three stages in the development of the eggs were recognized .
Stage I consisted of immature eggs only , ranging in diameter to about 0.135 mm ; stage II , an intermediate group of eggs ranging from 0.135 to 0.375 mm ; and finally stage 111 , mature eggs ranging in diameter from 0.445 to 0.775 mm .
Frequency distributions of the egg-diameters from ( 1 ) immature females containing immature eggs only , ( 2 ) mgturing females containing immature and intermediate eggs , and ( 3 ) mature females containing immature , intermediate and mature eggs , are shown in Figure 1 .
The immature eggs are present in the ovary at all times of the year , but the intermediate and maturing groups are found only during the spawning season .
It takes nearly two weeks for the intermediate eggs to differentiate into mature eggs .
When the eggs are fully mature , they burst from their follicles and become segregated in the lumen of the ovary .
The mature egga are translucent and contain a single oil globule .
The females were classified by gross examination based on ' ova ' characteristics into immature , intermediate or maturing groups .
Immature ovaries contained no eggs visible to the naked eye ; intermediate ovaries contained small , creamy-white , opaque eggs visible to the naked eye ; maturing ovaries contained larger eggs which were translucent rather than opaque .
Since the intermediate and maturing groups of eggs were never found in the gonads except during the spawning senson , the presence of either one or both of these classes indicated that the fish would spawn within the next few days .
Consequently , to determine the da , tes of the spawning se !
son , fish of the intermediate class were grouped wrth those of the maturing class and only two categories used , immature amd m9 , turing : The percentage of adult females in the maturlng group was calculated for each month for which data were available .
The results are shown in Figure 2 .
FIG , z. Percentage of maturing females recorded by months , The curve in Figure 2 shows that a great ms.jority of the ~ d u l t femdes mature during the months of March and April and in August , and relatively fewer fish mature during the months of May , June and July .
Obviously , the fish spawns from March till August or September but the peaks of spawning occur during the months of April and August .
The males .
during these months were a , lso seen fully mature .
FREQUENCY OF SPAWNING It was found that by the tirne a. group of eggs had atta.ined maturity , a second maturing group was distinguishable at the upper range of the intermediate group .
Such a group of maturing eggs appears between 0.25 and 0.37 mm in the lower graphs ( C & D ) of Figure 1 .
The second maturing group gradually develops from the intermediate class as the first maturing eggs increase in ' size , and by the time the first eggs are ready to be spa.wned the second lot can bc clearly distinguished .
Besides , in several instances , females with a maturing group of eggs in the ovary hzd also a few ma.ture eggs lying in the lumen of the gonzd .
These eggs were undoubtedly the remnants of a previous spawning .
If there was only one spawning during a season , one would expect to find only two groups of eggs in the spawning female , i.e ., the immature ( Stage I ) and the mature ( Stzge 111 ) .
This was not the case in the fish examined and it is , therefore , reasonable to conclude that L. splendens spawns more than once in a season .
FECUNDITY A series of 12 maturing gonads wa.s examined by first weighing the gonads , then weighing sma.11 portions of the goned and counting the eggs contained in e ~ c h lot .
Two portions were taken from each ovary , at anterior and posterior points , and an estimate was rna.de of mem egg-weight of each ovav from these four samples .
Direct computations of egg number from the g0na.d weights and the mean egg weight gave the following values : Average length of fish Number of eggs 58.6 mm .

Thc larger fish may contain up to 11,000 eggs .

The first two modes represent fish belonging to age-group I and the third mode represents fish belonging to age-group 11 .
The fishof age-group I appearing at 30 mm must ha.ve been born in August a.nd those of age-group I appearing at 50 mm , in April of 1949 .

The presence of two modes in the first year class was also observed in samples collected in August , September , October and November , 1950 .
This bimodality of the first year cless is probably due to the fish spawning a.t its peak twice a year .
I t cannot be accounted for as being due to errors in sampling because the la.rge numbers of fish constituting the samples obviate this possibility The rate of growth was estimated from the average incda.1 length of the fish in each year-group i n the collections taken from September 1949 to November 1950 .
These averages are plotted in Figure 4 , a.nd the growth curves are smoothed by eye .
The year-classcs indica.ted by the date of spawning .
Thus , the 1949 class ccnstituted the a.ge-group I until March 1950 , when it was considered the a.gc-group 11 .
Fish which hatched in March 1950 attained an average modal length of 17 mm in April , 22 mm in Ma.y , 32 mm in June , 35 mm in July , 47 mm in August and 65 mm in November of the same yea.r .

Average len th of the year-claases at different seasons of the year , stowing the growth rate during the h r t two years .
the growth in the second year is very slow , the fish attaining a length of only 72 mm at the end of the second year of its life .
SIZE AT FIRST MATURITY In determining the size at first maturity , only fish taken during the peak of the spawning season were used .
The presence of eggs of stage I1 ( Intermediate ) and of stage I11 ( Mature ) in the ovary was considered sufficient evidence that spawning would be accomplished during the same season .
The number of immature and mature fish grouped by 5 mm length-classes are shown in Table 2 .
The percentage of mature fish among those of each length are plotted in Figure 5 .
The curve is smoothed with eye to show the trend .

6.8 per cent of the females were mature at 55 mm ; 52 per cent at 60 mm ; 98 per cent at 65 mm ; and practically all fish over 68 mm in length were mature .
Thus it may safely be stated that L. splendem first matures at an average length of 60 mm or at the end of the first year of its life .

In the formula , W = weight , L = length , c = a-constant which differs for different species , and n expresses the slope of the graph of logarithms .

The resulting line was very definitely a straight line .
The va.Iue of n was found to be 3.2 and that of log c , -4.8233 .

SUMMARY The silver belly , Leiognathus splendetrs , forms an important fishery of Thangachimadam on the Rameswaram Island , the annual catch being500tans , bringing a value of nearly Rs .
2,00,000 to the fishermen .
The principal gear used commercially for the capture of the silver belly is a bag-net ( 1oca.lly known as Mada valak ) having a mesh of & inch .
The net is operated from the boat catamarans .
The fishing is done in depths from 3 to 6 fathoms .
L ,. splendens maitures at an average standard length of 60 millimeters and spaawns from March till September , the peaks of the spawning period being in April and August .
The mature eggs are spherical , translucent , contain a single oil globule and measure from 0.51 to 0.77 mm in diameter .
Each fish matures rapidly and spawns more than once in a season .
An ovary contains an a , vera , ge of 7,566 eggs .
The larger fish may contain up to 11,000 eggs .
The length-frequency distributions for the months for which data were available show that L. splendens attains an average standa.rd length of 60 mm at the end of the first year a.nd 72 mm at the end of the second year of its Life .
No fish was observed to attain a standard length of more than 85 mm .
The weight of the fish incrcases at a rate slightly greater than the cube of the length .
The correct formula .
for the length-weight relationship was found to be W = .00 M ) 15 ( L ) 3.2 , where W = weight in grams , and L .

MATERIAL AND METHODS The life history was traced mainly by securing eggs and larvae from plankton collected at the surface and near the bottom from places ranging in depth from 2 to 13 faihoms , with nets made of organdy and ordinary mull .
In addition to inshorc hauls , offshore samples collected once a. weck from December 1949 to the end of May 1950 a.t places approximately 20 fathoms deep have also been examined .
Nauplii and Protozoea.e were obtained by ha.tching eggs and rewing the early larvae in small glass vessels and Isere compa.red with correspondingstages isolated from plankton .
La.te lzrval stages were secured both from plankton and by getting the immediately preceding stage to moult Adult and adolescent prawns have been collected from numerous brackish water localities such as Ennur and Pulicat near Madras , the mouth of the Adyar river in the same pla.ce , the backwaters dong the Kerda coast a.nd the mouths of some streams in the neighbourhood of Calicut .
Samples from commercial catches .
were studied frequently .
Valuable material was also available from the regular bi weekly catches of fish made for the 1abora.tory from the foreshore waters at West Hill , Calicut , up to a depth of 4 fathoms .
Three types of nets are being used for this purpose , namely the gill net , the cast net and the boax seine 1oca.lly czlled ' paithuvala ' and these collections proved invaluable , especislly in the study of the bionomics of the species .

LIFE HISTORY The life histories of a number of peneeids are fully known from the work of Gurney , Hudinaga , Dakin , Pearson and Mme Heldt .
But none of the species are from Indian seas .
The only published account of the larvae of an Indian form is that of Penaeus indicus given by the present writer ( 1937 ) .
Only the Protozoea and Zoea sta.ges hzve been described , since the series was incomplete in the collection .
So far 2 , s the genus Metapenaeus is concerned larvae of only one species are known , namely those of M. stebbingi described by Gurney ( 1927 ) from the Suez Canal .
I t will be evident from the following account that the course of development of the Indian species follows on closely pa.raHe1 lines , having the same number of s t e e s with numerous characters in common .

Eggs .
Figs 1-3 .
Eggs were obtained only from plankton , for there were no facilities for keeping mature females alive until they shed their eggs .
Though penaeid eggs are believed to be demersal , large numbers of them belonging to M. Hobsoni were found in plankton collections on several days made near the bottom as well as at the surface .
They a.re buoyant and are easily stirred up by disturbances caused by currents : or waves .
These eggs have large perivitelline spaces like those of Trachypenaeus constrictus ( Pearson 1939 ) rendering them much lighter than those of some other species a.nd this peculiarity may account for their presence in surfice samples .
Kith few exceptions the eggs obtained were in later stages of development .
Two of them hare bee11 figured .
One seems to be immediately after completion of segmentation , and the other with the rudiments of the 3 pairs of naupliar a.ppendages developed as buds bent over the ventral surface of the embryo .
Each egg measures 0,44 mm in diameter and is perfectly spherical .
In a few samples there were some slightly smdler , being only 0.35 mm in dia.meter .
On hatching , the latter naturaIly gave rise to nauplii which were smaller , though the difference is too little to attract notice in a collection of both .
Detailed study of the appendages failed to bring out any marked difference between the two sets of larvae either in this or the two subsequent stages .
I t seems fairly certain therefore that both sets of eggs belong to the same species .
The eggs of M. stsbbingi also are reported by Gurney to vary from 0.32-0.41 mm in diameter .
Both the early embryos and the fully developed nauplii do not fill the eggs completely , a wide space , the perivitelline space , being left around them .
The embryo is closely invested by a thin embryonic mernbrwe which ruptures later and the nauplius comes to lie within the egg membrane with thc appendages partly straightenedoue so as to occupy the entire space inside .
Eggs transferred to clean sea water in finger bowls or other glass containers kept cool b'y being stood in wa.ter , hatched invariably in the course of a few hours , the time varying , of course , with the state of development of * the contained embryos .
Some of the earliest batches of eggs secured in plankton behaved , however , in an entirely different manner .
On 2 or 3 days in the month of September 1949 , when the inshore water was extremely turbid due to rains and stormy weather , it was noticed that while some of the eggs kept overnight hatched normally , many did not ha.tch at all .
In the latter set , however , the embryos continued to develop and in the course of the day had changed into protozoeae tha.t were alive and showing movements though still enclosed within the embryonic membranes .
They continued to live for a few hours , but later died , having failed to break the egg membranes .
Though eggs were plentiful , 1a.rva.e were surprisingly few in plankton on those days , showing thereby that either the va.st ma , jority of eggs perished without hatching or that the nauplii into which they h ~ tched died soon afterwa.rds .
As in M. stebbingi , there are only 3 naup1ia.r stages , though in species of Penaeus , Trachypenaeus and Sicyonia several more sta.ges have been observed by Hudinzga .

that the last stage is somewhat semi transparent .
Stage 1 .
- Figs .
4-5 , Length from anterior to posterior end excluding caudal setae 0.26-0.28 mm .
I t agrees closely with that of M. stebbingi .
The body is opaque , pear-shaped and unsegmented and has a pair of short setae at the posterior end .
A prominent hump-like elevation is present on the dorsal surface .
Ventrally there is the labrum , which in this stage is in the form of an approximately conical process with no free flap extending backwards .
A median nauplius eye is visible in front of severalindividuals .
The usual 3 pairs of appendages namely antennuies , antennae and mandibles are present , the two latter being biramous .
Antennules-Uniramous , unjointed with 5 setae at the extremity , 2 of which are longer than the rest .
Antennae-Biramous ; both rami unjointed .
Exopodite with 5 setae along inner margin and tip ; endopodite with 3-4 .
Mandibles-Biramous ; branches short , each with 3 terminal setae .

Nauplius eye present in all .
Posterior end of body , which carried anal setae in the previous stage , has elongated to become a short broad bilobed telson , each lobe carrying 6 setae , 2 on the outer margin and I inside being little more than points .
Labrum is now free .
Antennules-Faintly segmented .

The body appears more slender than in thelast stage .
The shell fold extends backwards to include the somite of second maxilla and thetelson has elongated further so as to form a conspicuous part of the posterior region of the body , the median notch of which has deepened .
Its spine formula remains the same , but in olderfoms a minute point-likeadditional spine may be seen on tlie inner margin of each lobe .
A pair of minute frontal organs are visible at the anterior end .
Antennule-Distinctly jointed with a few setae on the inner margin as in previous stage .
mass without pigment which later on becomes the stalked eye .
In older larvae belonging to the same stage a patch of pigment develops at their outer extremities , The frontal organs are quite prominent and are slender and pointed : Such pointed frontal organs , as remarked by Gurney ( 1943 ) ~ are present only in one other genus of Penaeinae , viz .
Purapenaeus .
All thoracic segments are well differentiated and the first abdominal somite is also faintly marked out .
Co1ouration .
- A pair of branching reddish brown chromatophores at the posterior margin of the telson and one at the base of each second maxilliped ; otherwise the larva is more or less transparent .

Rami in older larvae appeared to be quite empty as noted by Gurney also .
Labrum and paragnatha quite prominent and behind them rudiments of the following q pairs of appendages are free and biramous with minute setae in larvae approaching the moult into the protozoea stage .
PROTOZOEA Stage I. - Figs .
15-m .
Length 0.67-0.74 mm The moult from the last nauplius to the first protozoea brings about striking changes in the appearance of the larva .
The anterior part of the body is now covered over by a flat and approximately oval carapace extending up to the second segment of the thorax .
The nauplius eye persists and on either side of it there is a cellular Antennule-Not quite half as long as body ; 5 segments marked out proximally beyond which 2 long joints ; 2 long but unequal setae and 3 aesthetes at tip and a few setae on the inner and outer sides .
Antenna-A two-jointed protopodite , flagellum and exopodite present .
Flagellum shorter , two-jointed and with 4 setae i t tip and 2 pairs proximally .
Scale with 9 segments ; 9 plumose setae along inner margin and tip and 2 on outer margin on segments 4 and 6 .
Mandible-Consists only of masticatory portion , the 2 rami having disappeared during the moult .
Labrum is prominent and bears a small forwardly directed spine .
Maxilla I. - Consists of a basal portion produced into 2 endites , each with a number of short setae , a papillalike exopod carrying 4 plumose setae and afaintly threejointed endopod .
Maxilla 2 .
- Protopodite produced inwards into 5 endites , each armed with several setae .
Exopod similar t o that of maxilla I and carries 5 plumose setae ; endopod four-jointed , each joint having 2-3 setae .

Maxilliped 2 .
- Similar to the first , but with much fewer setae on proto and endopodites .
Maxilliped 3 .
- Smal1 , biramous rudiment with 2 setae at the tip of outer branch .
No other appendages are present .
Telson has 2 lobes , separated by a wide notch , each lobe having 7 setae , 4th from the outer srde being the longest .
Unlike the nauplius , the protozoea feeds actively .
In thelaboratory they thrived well on diatoms and other forms of phyto-plankton mixed with microscopic animal forms which could not be separated .
Stage II. - Fig. 22 .
Length 0:81 -0 .
~ 8 mm One of the most important advances which this stage shows over the first is the presence of well developed movable stalked eyes completely free from thecarapace .
Between them the median eye is still clearly visible .
The anterior portion of the carapace is prolonged forwards between the eyes into a broad process which abruptly narrows into a short pointed rostrum .
In older larvae there is a pair of small supraorbital spines , whichin others are easily missed .
Behind the thorax all abdominal somites except the last , are distinctly marked out .
The telson remains unchanged with the same spine formula , namely 7 + 7 .
The appendages do not show much difference from those of the first except for the addition of one or more setae in some , as for esample in the esopodites of the first and second masd - lipeds which have now 7 and 6 setae respectively .
Both branches of maxilliped 3 are approximately equal in length , the inner of which is unjointed andunarmed and the outer tippedwith 3 setae .
Small knoblilce rudiments of the remaining 5 pairs of thoracic appendages are also present .
Colourntion .
- In addition to those noted in Stage I similar chromatophores have developed on the posterior surface of the ocular penduncles , labrum and ventrally in the region of the maxillipeds .

sixth abdominal segment is now cut off from the telson and the uropods have developed .
The first : 5 have small median spines dorsally and the fifth has a pair of lateral spines as well .
The sixth segment has 2 pairs of lateral spines , a small dorsolateral pair and a slightly larger ventrolateral pair .
Telson is unchanged with the same spine formula namely 7 + 7 .
In Penaeus , Penaeopsis , Parapenaeus and Trachypenaeus the spine formula is 8 + 8 so that in this respect Metapenaeus differs from the other genera of the Penaeinae .
Nauplius eye is still visible and both the rostrum and supraorbital spines have grown .
Co1ournfion .
- Most of the chromatophores noted in stage I1 have grown larger and become branched , especially those on the telson .
Ne ~ y ones have appeared in the middle of each abdominal somite and the exopodites of the uropods .
Antennule-Basal segmentation is hardly risible so that the appendage seems 3-jointed .

ZOEA ( Mysis ) .
While discussing the nomenclature of the different stages in the larval development of Decapoda , Gurney ( 1942 ) has pointed out the inappropriateness of the term Mysis .
He has remarked that `` it is an unfortunate term , implying a false relationship and it is not easily definable .
Referring as it does t o a stage with biramous legs , ir cannot legitimately be applied t o a stage with no exopods , although that stage is precisely equivalent to a Mysis stage in other forms .
Furthermore , if the term is really used , as it has been , to imply a phylogenetic meaning , it should be applied to a stage in which the thoracic legs are free from the carapace , since thia is a much more fundamental feature of the Mysidacea than the possession of exopods '' .
He has suggested the term zoea instead and it is used here , The moult from the last protozoea to the zoea brings about a striking change in the shape of the larva which now assumes that of the adult prawn .
Besides the change in shape , the functional development of the exopodites of all the 5 pairs of walking legs and the appearance of the pleopods ( in the later stages ) are the other important advances of the zoea over the protozoea .
Colouration .
- The colouration is similar to that of protozoea 111 .
The pigment spots on the abdominal segments have begun to branch and in the later stages appear like vertically arranged plates forming one of the distinguishing features of the species .
Stage I. - Figs .
26-33 .
Length 1.8-2.3 mm The rostrum reaches to the middle of the cornea of the eyes and bears no teeth ; a short distance behind its base there is a small median papilla .
A small antenna1 spine and a much larger pterygostomian spine behind the base of the antenna are present .
Abdominal segments 5 and 6 have small median dorsal spines , an anal spine arises close t o the margin of the laat segment .
Labral spine and the nauplius eye are still present .
Maxilliped I and 2 .
- Hardly any change from those of Protozoea 111 .
Maxilliped 3 .
- Endopodite 5-jointed ; exopodite with setae at tip and functional .
Legs I-5 .
- Small and indistinctly segmented with functional exopodites .
A small gill present at the base of each of the first 4 legs .
The development of gills at this stage seems rather precocious when compared to the Suez Canal larvae in which they develop only in the last zoea .
Pleopods absent .
Telson and Uropods-Telson roughly parallel-sided with the posterior margin deeply cleft ; spine formula 8 + 8, one on each side being ?

Uropods .
- Exopodite with a spine and 16-17 setae ; endopodite also has an equal number .
POST-LARVAE Stage I. - Figs .
43-50 .
Length 3-3.5 mm The moult at the close of the zoea stage brings about two striking changes in the organization of the animal , namely the loss of exopodites from the thoracic appendages and the development of setae on the pleopods so as to make them functional and the chief natatory organs of the young prawn .
According to Burkenroad this is usual in the subfamilies Penaeinae and Sicyoninae .
In this species they do not completely disappear , degenerated stumps persisting in scjme individuals .
Rostrum has the same number of teeth as in the last zoea ; in older individuals an extremely minute tooth also in front of the other two .
A small somewhat triangular antenna1 spine is present ; but the anterolateral angle of the carapace is not produced into a distinct pterygostomian spine .
Hepatic spine quite conspicuous .
Median dorsal spine only on the last abdominal somite , anal spine absent .
Spine on labrum also absent ; but on ventral surface of seventh thoracic somite a large forwardly bent spine has developed .
Pleopods , though uniramous , are setose and functional .
Antennule-Differs but little from that of last zoea .
Antenna-A small spine on protopodite .

Mi.nute spines have developed on basipodites of first 3 palrs .
Pleopods-Exopodites fringed with numerous setne ; endopodites absent .
Telson-Changed very little .
Post-larvae , older than the one described , were absent from plankton , although a large number of samples collected from close to the shore up to 12-13 fathoms were examined in the course of over an year .
This contrasts markedly with the corresponding stages of P. carinatris and P. indicus which are frequently captured in the tow-net not only from the sea , but also from estuaries and backwaters connected with the sea .
Presumably they go down soon after the moult into the second stage and adopt the bottom living habit .
In order to trace the successive changes brought about by each following moult on some of the structures which differ markedly from those of the adult like the rostrum , pleopods and teison , a few first stage post-larvae were reared separately in finger bowls and at every moult the shed skin was removed and examined .
The moulting always happened at nightso that the skins could be examined only the next morning .
This method mas dopted because of the difficulty of rearing a large number of specimens in order that one or two may be killed and ernmined a t each moult .
Despite its imperfection the method yielded a fairly good picture of their gradual development until they acquired the adult form .
These observations were started on 22-6-50 with 4 individuals obtained on that day from the last zoea stage .
Moulting occurred at intervals of 2 days at first , but subsequently the periods became somewhat irregular .
The dates on which one of the specimens moulted are given below : 1950 , June 23 , 25 , 27 July 2 , 5 , 9 , 11 , 20 This specimen died shortly after the last moult .
Another individual which had passed into the same stage on 21-7-50 moulted on 25-7-50 , 28-7-50 , 2-8-50 , 4-8-50 , 9-8-50 and 13-8-50 .
As the parts mentioned above had acquired the adult characteristics at this stage no attempt was made to follow the moults regularly thereafter .
Their gradual development during this period of approximately a month and 3 weeks is briefly summarised below : Post-larva 11 - .
A minute third tooth on rostrum ; pleopods and telson unchanged .
Post-larva 111-3 x-ell developed teeth on rostrum ; pleopods and telson unchanged .
Post-larva IV-Rostrum broken ; pleopods unchanged ; telson considerably narrower posteriorly ; spines on its posterior margin between the l ~ r g e ones at the angles quite small .

Rostrum with j teeth and the dorsal crest characteristic of the adult just developed ; minute knoblike endopodites w ~ t h setae on pleopods 2 - j ; posteromedian process of telson larger .
Post-larva VIII-Rostrum with a point-like 6th tooth ; endopodites of pleopods as fingerlike processes ; posteromedian process of telson reaches almost to extremity of large spines , the s ~ naller ones reduced to mere points .
Antenna1 flagellum about two and a half times as long as scale .
Post-larva IX-Rostrun ~ with 6 fully developed teeth , endopodites of posterior pleopods about half of exopods ; posteromedian process of telson just projects beyond tips of large spines ; antennal flagelIum about four times as long as scale .
Post-larva X-Rostrum with a pointlike 7th tooth ; endopodites of pleopods prominent and fringed with several setae ;, posteromedian process of telson much the same as in last stage ; antennal flagellum stretches backwards up to the middle of telson .
Post-larva XI-Rostrum with 7 teeth ; pleopods as in last stage ; posteromedian process of telson longer and the two large spines of previous stages reduced ; a small thin process has developed on the protopodite of the first pleopod , which is the rudiment of the petasma .
Post-larva XII-Rostrum with a minute 8th tooth ; large spines on either side of the median process of telson hardly larger than anterior lateral teeth ; antennal flagella stretch considerably beyond tip of telson ; rudiment of petasma larger .
Post-larva XIII-Rostrum with 8 fully developed teeth ; endopodites of pleopods and petasmal rudiments have grown slightly ; lateral teeth of telson hardly visible .
The number of teeth on the adult rostrum is never more than 8. Starting with 2 in the first post-larva , the & I1 number is therefore established in the course of a succession of rz moults .
DEVELOPMENT OF EXTERNAL SEXUAL ORGANS The petasmn or andricum and the thelycum ( receptaculum seminis ) of the male and female respectively afford easily recognizable characters of taxonomic value and a brief account of their development is therefore added below : Petasma .
- Figs .
53-57 .
I t is made up of z halves , each borne bv the vrotovodite of the first pleopod .
As noted already it develops as a short thin foliac ~ ous process from about the middle of the protopodite in the r rth post-larval stage when the animal is slightly over I F mm in length .
I t gladually grows during succeeding moults a d at the-same time its margins turn inwards so as to form an open groove .
The outer part of its tipis gradually produced into a spout-shaped process called the distolateral lobe by Burkenroad ( 1934 b ) .
At the same time the anterior margin of each half develops minute hooks all along its length .
At first the hooks are arranged in a single row , those towards the extremity being separated by wide intervals .
As growth proceeds additional rows are developed in the proximal part while those situated distally areclosely arranged .
These interlock and give rise to an incom - plete tube open behind through the space left between their posterlor margins .
The distolateral lobes are also open .
T h n happens usually when the young prawn is 50-60 mm .
Some tlme befote this the anterior margin of the spout develops a small flap or lobe at the inner end .
I t gradually extends along a good part of the length of the spout and the surface becomes corrugated .
Thespace inside each spout , which was open , is closed by the growth of its posterior margin .
Two pairs of papillae are developed at the base of the spouts , one pair anterior and the other posterior in position .
The former are stout with curled-up tips , the latter thin and leaflike .
In prawns of about 65 mrn the petasma is completely developed .
Thelycum-Figs .

The earliest stage in development was not obtained , but in a specimen measuring approximately 25 mm there is a broad roughly crescentic groove running transversely across FIGS .

Three developmental stages of thdycunl : 58 , goove on sternum XIV just formed ; j9 .
hood growing from its posterior margin ; 60 , hood practically corers up the groove .
the anterior part of the sternum of the last ( XIV ) thoracic segment .
Laterally it stretches up to the base of the last two pairs of legs .
On the sternum of the penultimate segment ( XIII ) t h e ~ e is a median elongated process , its lateral margins posteriorly beconzing continuous with the front marbin of the groove .
This is the ' median tongue ' referred to by Alcock ( 1906 ) and gives rise to the median plate of the adult thelycum .
From its position it appears to be formed by the enlargement of the median spine noticeable in eatly post-larvae .
Later it broadens out ventrally into a conspicuous , approximately quadrilateral plate with the concave surface connected w ~ t h the sternum by a nanow dorsal part .
At the same time t h t posterior margin of the groove grows and forms a flap or hood enclosing its cavity .
It extends on each side from the middle line and gradually overlaps the lateral poltions of the posterior half of the median plate , its anterior ends being partly concealed under the lateral margins of the front half of the Iatfer .
This is the ' salient horse-shoe shaped process described by Alcock as ensheathing posteriorly the ' Median tonxue ' .
The inner ends of the two hoods eventually meet along the median line so that there is hardly any gap left between them and the median plate as in M. brevkomis Burkenroad ( 1g34b ) , through which spermataphores could be inserted at the tjme of copulation .
In the fully developed thelycum seen in prawns of approximately 60 mm in length the anterior opening of the groove on each side is blocked in front at the level of the front end of the median plate by ashort stout spine arising from the coax of the fourth leg .
No part of the cavity of the groove is dilated as iLl other genera though the front end of each side is wide and the lateral portions are continuous in the middle line .
BIONOMICS Breeding .
( a ) Place Penaeid prawns , with the exception of M. stebbingi and M. monoceros , breed , as fa.r a.s is known , only in the sea .
M. stebbingi has been observed to breed in the Bitter Lakes of the Suez Canal and M. monoceros in the shallow coastal lakes of New South Wa.lcs ( Dakin , 1946 ) .
So far as present observations go , M. dobsoni seems to breed ma.inly in the sea .
In discussing the habits of the species of Meta.penReus living in the Chilkv .
lake Kemp ( 1915 ) states : ' I think it improbable that any of them breed in the la.ke ' .
Eggs and larvae have been so far collected only in the sea though early post-larvae attributed to Metapenaeus monoceros have been recorded from brackish-water ( Panikkar & Aiyyar 1939 ) .
Further , samples of plankton collected from brackish water areas where the adults are found throughout the year , for example the backwaters of Adyar and Kerala ., ham failed to show any 1arva.e or eggs .
These two facts strongly suggest the sea as the breeding place of this species .
Study of adult prawns has also yielded reliable evidence in its support .
While mature males with well developed spermatophores have been frequently collected from brackish water , no female , either impregnated or with ripe ovary , has so far been obtained from the same area.s .
Sexual union and ripening of the female gonad seem to take place only in the sea .
Adult females from the sea have invariably the fifth pair of legs reduced to stumps .
Kemp noted that in every female obtained from the Chilka lake these legs were of normal length .
Commenting on this he remarks : ' I t appears to me highly probable , as has already been suggested by Nobili , that the degeneration of these limbs is in some way connected with reproduction and , if this should prove to be the case , the condition of the Chilka specimens lends support to the view , based on other evidence , that this species at any rate does not breed in the lake ' .
However , the possibility of some of them breeding in environments similar to l hose in which M. monoceros is reported to breed cannot be ruled out altogether .
( b ) Period The breeding period seems to be fairly long as evidenced by the presence of larvae in plankton from September to April .
The maximum number was obtained from November to March .
Eggs occurred in plankton in fair numbers from September to the middle of January , after which the number dropped abruptly , none being obtained on several days .
Plankton samples up to January contained mostly larvae of this species and in all probability therefore most of the eggs also should belong to the same .
From both sets of observations it would seem that the period September to December or January forms the peak of the spawning season .
( c ) Area Details of the1 localities and method of making plankton collections have been already given .
The offshore collections , contained very few penaeid larvae and practically no eggs .
None has been made between this and the 12-13 fathoms region so that their distribution in this area is unknown fit present .
Basing our conclusions on the data available it may be stated that a good number of breeding females liberate their eggs in the inshore waters up to or slightly beyond the 12-13 fathoms line .
In making this statement the effect of currents on the distribution of eggs and larvae has been left out of consideration owing to the lack of any information rega.rding them .
Judging from the known distribution of planktonic eggs and larvae Pearson ( 1939 ) and Anderson and co-workers ( 1949 ) conclude that spawning of P. setiferus is done usually in offshore areas of the South Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the TJnited States of America .
Dakin ( 1938 ) has stated that P , plebejus of Australia breeds in ocean water weil out of the estuaries .
The Indian species apparently differs from them ina.smuch as it spawns in the comparatively sha , Ilom inshore waters .
Sexual union .
Impregnated females have been obtained prac - tically throughout the year , the largest number being in the months of August to January and this period roughly coincides with the peak of the breeding season .
Females , soon after sexual union , can be easily recognized because of the pair of prominent white pads that cover the surface of the thelycum .
Each pad is completely formed in the vas deferens and can be found together with the spermatophore ( occasionally 2 spermatophoree , one being smaller ) in the terminal dilatation of the vas deferens situated at the base of the last leg .
Burkenroad ( 1934b ) has accepted the suggestion of Kishinoye that these pads are ' perhaps rudimentary homologues of the appendages of the spermatoptrore of Penaeus ' the function of which is stated to be ' for attachment of the exposed spermatophores in Penaeids with open thelycum ' .
The smallest impregnated female measured just over 65 mm .
' Food .
The food of the larvae has been already described .
The statement of Alcock regarding the feeding habits of adult prawns that ' they are scavengers , but many are carnivorous in a better sense and several species prey upon marine larvae and microscopic algae ' is true of young ones as well .
Small post-larvae thrived well on plankton containing a good proportion of a1ga.l constituents .
Later on small quantities of finely minced clam or fish muscles were given in addition to plaakton .
Examination of the stomach contents of numerous individuals varying in length from 21-88 mm has been carried out in order to discover the food constituents in the natural habitat of these prawns and the variations , if any , in the proportion'of these constituents at different stages of growth .
The food in general consists of varying amounts of organic matter mixed with sand and mud .
Fragments or entire bodies of small animals and algae including diatoms compose the organic matter , of which the proportion of vegetable constituents has been found to be less in the larger individuals .
In some specimens measuring 21 - 45 mm in length examined on 22-11-49 and 6-12-49 the stomachs were practically full of fragments of the alga Cladophora mixed with mud and some diatoms , no recognizable animal remains being present .
Individuals measuring 65-75 mm contained only a few fragments of the same alga .
The animal matter largely consists of entire or partly digested bodies of the following groups ( No attempt were reared and final size to which they grew are was made to determin their identities more exactly ) : given below : Foraminifera , Copepoda ., Nematoda , Amphipoda Initial size .

During the breeding period females of 50-70 mm were found with fully ripe ovaries so that sexual maturity may also be attained at about this age .

92 Hill , Cdicut , up to a depth of 4 fathoms in Sovember and December .
Later there was a fall in number , but they continued to a.ppear in the catches up to the end of April .
It is quite probable that migration from the sea takes place when the young have reached this size and that successive batches pass out of the sea during the greater part of the breeding period ( see also fanikkar 1937 ) .
The maximum size of prawns collected from backwaters amd estuaries , as stated already , does not exceed SO mm .
Kemp records that specimens from the Chilka lake examined by him did not exceed 75 mm .
The backward migration into the sea ma.y ta.ke place soon after the monsoon rains start , the prawns being carried in the current flowing into the sea .
As the largest individuals measure a s much as 120 rnm and have been found only in the sea they do not seem to leave the sea afterwards a.nd re-enter their former habitat .
Kemp also has arrived at the same conclusion in regard to the pemeids of the Chilka lake .
It may be of interest to mention here tha-t the investigation on the osmotic regulation in M. monoceros has demonstrated its high adaptability to water of varying salinity ( Panikkar and Viswanathan 1948 ) .
Presumably this power is shared by M. dobsoni and other migratory penaeids .
SUMMARY The 1arva.l development of M. dobsoni resembles closely that of M. stebbingi having the same number of stages and numerous common characters .
Rostrum , eelson and pleopods have been observed to acquire approximately a.du1t character in the course of 12 moults .
The species breeds mainly in the sea in comparatively shallow inshore waters and the period is fairly long , extending over 5-6 months .
The food of larvae and early post-larvae consists chiefly of plankton ; they later become bottomfeeding in habit , their stomach contents showing a good proportion of mud and sa.nd .
Considerable quantities of algae are consumed when a.vaila.ble .
Sexual ma.turity may be rezched in 7-8 months .
Like some other species of penaeids , M. dobsoni also migra.tes into estuaries and brackish waster area.s early in life and after a period of growth returns to the sea .
