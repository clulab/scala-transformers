# scala-transformers
Scala interfaces to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)/[ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) transformers and tokenizers

The libraries and models resulting from this project are incorporated into [processors](https://github.com/clulab/processors) and generally don't need attention unless functionality is being modified, but here are some details about how it all works.


## encoder

To use the encoder subproject as a Scala library dependency, you'll need to add something like this to your `build.sbt` file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.clulab" %% "scala-transformers-encoder" % "0.3.0"
```

For inference, you will need one of the trained [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) models generated by the subproject.  There are presently two available, and they are incorporated into a Scala project with

```scala
resolvers += "clulab" at "https://artifactory.clulab.org/artifactory/sbt-release"

// Pick one or more.
libraryDependencies += "org.clulab" % "deberta-onnx-model"  % "0.0.3"
libraryDependencies += "org.clulab" % "roberta-onnx-model"  % "0.0.2"

```

The models make reference to a tokenizer which also need to be added according to instructions in the next section.

Please see the [encoder README](encoder/README.md) for information about how to generate models and how to download and package Hugging Face tokenizers for use in the tokenizer subproject.

## tokenizer

To use the tokenizer subproject as a Scala library dependency, you'll need to add something like this to your `build.sbt` file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.clulab" %% "scala-transformers-tokenizer" % "0.3.0"
```

See the [tokenizer README](tokenizer/README.md) for information about which tokenizers have already been packaged and how the are accessed.
