# scala-transformers
Scala interfaces to huggingface transformers and tokenizers

To use the tokenizer subproject as a Scala library dependency, you'll need to add something like this to your `build.sbt` file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.clulab" %% "scala-transformers-tokenizer" % "0.1.0"
```
